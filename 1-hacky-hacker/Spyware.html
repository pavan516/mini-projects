Spyware Attack</h1></center>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Spyware is computer software that can be used to gather and remove confidential
information from any computer without the knowledge of the owner. Everything the
surfer does online, including his passwords, may be vulnerable to spyware.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


 Spyware
can put anyone in great danger of becoming a victim of identity theft. Moreover, some
forms of spyware can be installed on the computer from a remote location without the
identity thief ever having physical access to the victim's computer.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



While the term spyware suggests software that secretly monitors the user's
behavior, the functions of spyware extend well beyond simple monitoring. Spyware
programs can collect various types of personal information, but can also interfere with
user control of the computer in other ways, such as installing additional software,
redirecting Web browser activity, accessing websites blindly that will cause more
harmful viruses, or diverting advertising revenue to a third party. </p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Spyware can even
change computer settings, resulting in slow connection speeds, different home pages,
and loss of Internet or other programs. In an attempt to increase the understanding of
spyware, a more formal classification of its included software types is captured under
the term privacy-invasive software.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



In response to the emergence of spyware, a small industry has sprung up dealing
1ll anti-spyware software. Running anti-spyware software has become a widely
recognized element of computer security best practices for Microsoft Windows
desktop computers. A number of jurisdictions have passed anti-spyware laws, which
usually target any software that is surreptitiously installed to control a user's
computer.</p>




<h2>Routes of infection</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Spyware does not directly spread in the manner of a computer virus or worm:
generally, an infected system does not attempt to transmit the infection to other
computers. Instead, spyware gets on a system through deception of the user or
through exploitation of software vulnerabilities.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Most spyware is installed without users' knowledge. Since they tend not to install
software if they know that it will disrupt their working environment and compromise
their privacy, spyware deceives users, either by piggybacking on a piece of desirable
software such as Kazaa or Limewire, tricking them into installing it (the Trojan horse
method). </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Some "rogue" anti-spyware programs masquerade as security software,
while being spyware themselves. The distributor of spyware usually presents the
program as a useful utility - for instance as a "Web accelerator" or as a helpful
software agent. Users download and install the software without immediately
suspecting that it could cause harm.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Spyware can also come bundled with shareware or other downloadable software,
as well as music CDs. The user downloads a program and installs it, and the installer
additionally installs the spyware. Although the desirable software itself may do no
harm, the bundled spyware does. In some cases, spyware authors have paid shareware
authors to bundle spyware with their software. In other cases, spyware authors have
repackaged desirable free software with installers that add spyware.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


A third way of distributing spyware involves tricking users by manipulating
security features designed to prevent unwanted installations. Internet Explorer
prevents web sites from initiating an unwanted download. Instead, it requires a user
action, such as clicking on a link. However, links can prove deceptive: for instance, a
pop-up ad may appear like a standard Windows dialog box.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



 The box contains a
message such as "Would you like to optimize your Internet access?" with links which
look like buttons reading Yes and No. No matter which "button" the user presses, a
download starts, placing the spyware on the user's system. Later versions of Internet
Explorer offer fewer avenues for this.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



<h2>Solutions</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


As the spyware threat has worsened, a number of techniques have emerged to
counteract it. These include programs designed to remove or to block spyware, as
well as various user practices which reduce the chance of getting spyware on a
system. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Nonetheless, spyware remains a costly problem. When a large number of
pieces of spyware have infected a Windows computer, the only remedy may involve
backing up user data, and fully reinstalling the operating system.</p>




<h2>Security practices</h2>






<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


To deter spyware, computer users have found several practices useful in addition to
installing anti-spyware programs.

Many system operators install a web browser other than IE, such as Opera or
Mozilla Fire-fox. Although these have also suffered some security vulnerabilities,
their comparatively small market share compared to Internet Explorer makes it
uneconomic for hackers to target users on those browsers.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


 Though no browser is
completely safe, Internet Explorer is at a greater risk for spyware infection due to its
large user base as well as vulnerabilities such as Active x.
