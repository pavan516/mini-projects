&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Thanks to movies and books, our image of hackers has been distorted. What is worse, thepublic is not able to understand terms like grey hat, white hat, linux OS, or cracker. However,the truth is that the subculture of the hacker world is more complex than we think. Especially if we consider that, these are very intelligent people.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


So, what is ethical hacking white hat and how does it differentiate from grey hackers? The onlyway to find out is to submerge ourselves in the world of hackers and understand, at least, themost basic concepts.</p>




<h2>What Is A White Hat Hacker?</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


According to Hollywood, a hacker can be a wiz kid who spends too much time with computersand suddenly finds himself submerged in the world of cyber-security or criminal conspirators.On the other hand, he can be a master criminal who wants to obtain huge amounts of moneyfor him, or even worse, dominate the world.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


In the movie Matrix, the concept of hackers changed a bit. Although the agents of the Matrixconsidered them terrorists, the truth is that they were rebels fighting for the liberty of humanity. Things do not need to reach that extreme, though. We are not at war with intelligentma chines so that kind of scenario is a bit dramatic.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Therefore, a hacker is an individual who is capable of modifying computer hardware, orsoftware. They made their appearance before the advent of computers, when determinedindividuals were fascinated with the possibility of modifying machines. For example, entering adetermine code in a telephone in order to make free international calls.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      




When computers appeared, this people found a new realm where they could exploit their skills.

 
 
Now they were not limited to the constraints of the physical world, instead, they could travelthrough the virtual world of computers. Before the internet, they used Bulletin Board Systems(BBS) to communicate and exchange information. However, the real explosion occurred whenthe Internet appeared.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      



Today, anyone can become a hacker. Within that denomination, there are three types of hackers. The first one is the black hacker, also known as a cracker, someone who uses hiscomputer knowledge in criminal activ ities in order to obtain personal benefits. A typicalexample is a person who exploits the weaknesses of the systems of a financial institution formaking some money.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


On the other side is the white hat hacker. Although white hat hacking can be considered similarto a black hacker, there is an important difference. A white hacker does it with no criminalintention in mind. Companies around the world, who want to test their systems, contract whitehackers. They will test how secure are their systems, and point any faults that they may found.If you want to become a hacker with a white hat, linux, a PC and an internet connection is allyou need.</p>



<h2>Grey Hat Hackers?</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


A grey hat hacker is someone who is in between these two concepts. He may use his skills forlegal or illegal acts, but not for personal gains. Grey hackers use their skills in order to provethemselves that they can accomplish a determined feat, but never do it in order to makemoney out of it. The moment they cross that boundary, they become black hackers.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


For example, they may hack the computer network of a public agency, let us say, NOAA. That isa federal crime.

If the authorities capture them, they will feel the long arm of  justice. However, if they only get inside, and post, let us say, their handle, and get out withoutcausing any kind of damage, then they can be considered grey hackers.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


If you want to know more about hackers, then you can attend one of their annual conventions.Every year, hackers from all over the US, and from different parts of the world, reunite andmeet at DEF CON. These conventions are much concurred. In the last one, 6,600 people attended it.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Every year, DEF CON is celebrated at Las Vegas, Nevada. However, hackers are not the onlyones who go to this event. There are also computer journalists, computer securityprofessionals, lawyers, and employees of the federal government. The event is composed bytracks of different kind, all of them related, in some way, to the world of hackers (computersecurity, worms, viruses, new technologies, coding, etc). Besides the tracks, there are contests

 
 
that involve hacking computers, l ock picking and even robot related events. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Ethical hacking,white hat hacking or whatever names you wish to use, at the end, it has a purpose: to protectthe systems of organizations, public or private, around the world. After all, hackers can now belocated anywhere, and they can be counted by the millions. Soon, concepts like white hat, linuxoperating system or grey hat will become common knowledge. A real proof of how much hasour society been influenced by technology.</p>
