Although the history of hacking is relatively unknown to most of the public, it's quite interestingto read about it. It doesn't matter if you aren't a computer expert or a system administrator of a big corporation.Computers are as much part of our history as airplanes and cars, and it should be commonknowledge to know how they came to be. It's the only way you can understand the effects of computer hacking in our life.</p>



<h2>History of Hacking</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Hacking is not limited to computers. The real meaning of hacking is to expand the capabilities of any electronic device; to use them beyond the original intentions of the manufacturer. As amatter of fact, the first hackers appeared in the 1960's at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and their first victims were electric trains. They wanted them to performfaster and more efficiently. So, is hacking always bad? Not really. It only depends on how to useit. But it wasn't until a group of these hackers decided to exert their knowledge in the computermainframes of the MIT.</p>

During the 1970's, a different kind of hacker appeared: the phreaks or phone hackers. Theylearned ways to hack the telephonic system and make phone calls for free. Within these groupof people, a phreaker became famous because a simple discovery. John Draper, also known asCaptain Crunch, found that he could make long distance calls with a whistle. He built a blue boxthat could do this and the Esquire magazine published an article on how to build them.Fascinated by this discovery, two kids, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, decided to sell these blueboxes, starting a business friendship which resulted in the founding of Apple.</p>

By the 1980's, phreaks started to migrate to computers, and the first Bulletin Board Systems(BBS) appeared. BBS are like the yahoo groups of today, were people posted messages of anykind of topics. The BBS used by hackers specialized in tips on how to break into computers, howto use stolen credit card numbers and share stolen computer passwords.It wasn't until 1986 that the US government realized the danger that hackers represented tothe national security. As a way to counteract this menace, the Congress passed the ComputerFraud and Abuse Act, making computer breaking a crime across the nation.</p>

During the 1990's, when the use of the internet widespread around the world, hackersmultiplied, but it wasn't until the end of the decade that system's security became mainstreamamong the public.</p>

The most known of them is the iPod, which has revolutionizedthe music industry around the world. Jobs started nearly at the same time that Gates, foundingApple and introducing to the market the first home computer, the Apple II.Today, we are accustomed to hackers, crackers, viruses, Trojans, worms and all of thetechniques we need to follow to combat them.</p>

Unfortunately, there are as many bad hackers as productive hackers. One of the most famousblack hackers is Kevin Mitnick, who broke into the computers of several organizations, includingFujitsu, Motorola, Sun Microsystems and Nokia. He was imprisoned and even today can't use acomputer due to a judicial restriction.</p>

Another famous hacker is Vladimir Levin, a mathematician who led a group of Russian hackersand stole ten million dollars from Citibank. Until this day, no one knows how they did it.Jonathan James case is a bit more complicated. He was the first juvenile from the teen hackersof the USA to be prosecuted for computer hacking. But that didn't stop him. Later, he was ableto access the computer systems of NASA and the US Department of Defense. Finally, he was imprisoned.</p>

Years ago, before the coming of the internet, hackers around the world caused a lot of mayhemin organizations. But now that they have a potential market of hundreds of millions of persons,their options are almost limitless. That's why online fraud is considered one of the cancers of the internet. The only way to protect from it, is becoming an anti hacker ourselves, maintainingup to date with the most basic knowledge: firewall, antivirus, antispam, constant operatingsystem updates and taking care of suspicious websites.</p>

The effects of computer hacking in our history can't be denied. It is here and it won't disappear.But the most interesting thing about the history of hacking is that it was expected to happen.You only need to check old science fiction books to find it.</p>
