<h2>Trojan programs that share files via instant messenger</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Instant messaging allows file-sharing on a computer. All present popular instant
messengers have file sharing abilities, or allow users to have the above functionality
by installing patches or plug-ins; this is also a major threat to present information
security. These communication software also make it difficult for existing hack
prevention method to prevent and control information security. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Hackers use instant
communication capability to plant Trojan program into an unsuspected program; the
planted program is a kind of remotely controlled hacking tool that can conceal itself
and is unauthorized. The Trojan program is unknowingly executed, controlling the

infected computer; it can read, delete, move and execute any file on the computer.
The advantages of a hacker replacing remotely installed backdoor Trojan programs
with instant messengers to access files are: When the victim gets online, the hacker
will be informed. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Thus, a hacker can track and access the infected computer, and
incessantly steal user information.
A hacker need not open a new port to perform transmissions; he can perform his
operations through the already opened instant messenger port. Even if a computer
uses dynamic IP addresses, its screen name doesn't change.</p>





<h2>Hijacking and Impersonation</h2>



<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


There are various ways through which a hacker can impersonate other users. The most
commonly used method is eavesdropping on unsuspecting users to retrieve user
accounts, passwords and other user related information.</p>



<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The theft of user account number and related information is a very serious
problem in any instant messenger. For instance, a hacker after stealing a user's
information impersonate the user; the user's contacts not knowing that the user's
account has been hacked believe that the person they're talking to is the user, and are
persuaded to execute certain programs or reveal confidential information. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Hence, theft
of user identity not only endangers a user but also surrounding users. Guarding
against Internet security problems is presently the focus of future research; because
without good protection, a computer can be easily attacked, causing major losses.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Hackers wishing to obtain user accounts may do so with the help of Trojans
designed to steal passwords. If an instant messenger client stores his/her password on
his/her computer, then a hacker can send a Trojan program to the unsuspecting user.
When the user executes the program, the program shall search for the user's password
and send it to the hacker. There are several ways through which a Trojan program can
send messages back to the hacker. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The methods include instant messenger, IRC, emails,
etc. Current four most popular instant messengers are AIM, Yahoo! Messenger,
ICQ, and MSN Messenger, none of which encrypts its flow. Therefore, a hacker can
use a man-in-the-middle attack to hijack a connection, then impersonate the hijacked
user and participate in a chat-session.</p>





<h2>Denial of Service</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


There are many ways through which a hacker can launch a denial of service (DoS)
attack on an instant messenger user. A Partial DoS attack will cause a user end to
hang, or use up a large portion of CPU resources causing the system to become
unstable.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


There are many ways in which a hacker can cause a denial of service on an instant
messenger client. One common type of attack is flooding a particular user with a large
number of messages. The popular instant messaging clients contain protection against
flood-attacks by allowing the victim to ignore certain users. However, there are many
tools that allow the hacker to use many accounts simultaneously, or automatically
create a large number of accounts to accomplish the flood-attack.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


 Adding to this is the

fact that once, the flood-attack has started and the victim realizes what has happened,
the computer may become unresponsive. Therefore, adding the attacking user
accounts to the ignore list of the instant messenger client may be very difficult DoS
attacks are very easy to generate and very difficult to detect, and hence are attractive
weapons for hackers.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


 In a typical DoS attack, the attacker node spoofs its IP address
and uses multiple intermediate nodes to overwhelm other nodes with traffic. DoS
attacks are typically used to take important servers out of action for a few hours,
resulting in DoS for all users served by the server. It can also be used to disrupt the
services of intermediate routers.</p>
