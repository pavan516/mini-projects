<h2>State-sponsored hackers: hybrid armies? </h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Cyber-attacks are rarely disconnected from political 
realities. CyberBerkut -a pro-Russian group 
of  'patriot' hackers - has, for example, hacked 
German government websites in retaliation for 
the political support offered to Kiev by Berlin. 
The Syrian Electronic Army - a hacker collective 
thought to be linked to Syrian President Bassar 
al-Assad - regularly targets Western media outlets, 
most recently Le Monde. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Due to this blurring of the virtual and 
physical worlds, governments, which 
are familiar with stateless actors such as 
al-Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq and the 
Levant (ISIL), may now have to learn to deal 
with equally hostile, amorphous and often 
state-sponsored ‘hacktors’. </p>




<h2>Using the past but shaping the present </h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


While maritime disputes between China and 
its neighbours often grab the headlines in the 
Asia-Pacific, cyber-attacks are comparatively underreported. 
Each year, for instance, the commemoration 
of the Sino-Japanese conflict which 
began on 18 September 1931 (and resulted in 
Japan’s occupation of three provinces in northeast 
China) witnesses a virtual offensive on Japanese 
websites. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp




The ‘9/18’ cyber-attacks in recent years have 
been fuelled by a host of diplomatic disputes. In 

2010, the collision of a Chinese fishing boat with 
a Japanese coast guard vessel and the subsequent 
detainment of its Chinese captain and crew caused 
a flurry of malicious cyber activity. Attacks in later 
years were triggered by the 80th anniversary 
of the 1931 Manchuria incident or the ongoing 
controversy over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Non-state cyber armies have also been employed 
in ongoing conflicts. CyberBerkut is but the 
most recent example: the group not only managed 
to hack governmental websites in Germany, 
Ukraine and Poland, but also successfully took 
down three NATO websites, including that of the 
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence 
in Tallinn. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Other Russian political movements, which are organised 
and partially sponsored by the state, also 
have an important role in non-state cyber offensive 
capabilities. For instance, a group called ‘Nashi’ 
claimed responsibility for the Distributed-Denialof-
Service attack in Estonia in 2007. The group 
is also active domestically, targeting the Russian 
opposition and those critical of the government, 
including newspapers such as Kommersant. </p>



<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Smaller and militarily less advanced countries appear 
to readily embrace the actions of such ‘patriotic’ 
hackers as they benefit from the tactical 
asymmetry – a sort of virtual guerrilla warfare – 
that the cyberspace offers. The Syrian Electronic 
Army, active since the outbreak of protests in Syria 




in 2011, claims to be driven by patriotism and 
denies any official affiliation with the government. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The group is behind some of the more audacious 
cyber-attacks, including the defacement and hacking 
of numerous media websites and Twitter accounts 
(e.g. the BBC, The Guardian, The New York 
Times, Human Rights Watch, and Forbes), opposition 
Facebook pages, chat messengers like Skype 
and Viber, as well as foreign government institutions 
(e.g. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Defence). </p>

<h2>Examples of malware and state-linked 
cyber-attacks </h2>

<h3>Flame:</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



 Malware described as ‘the most sophisticated 
cyber weapon yet unleashed’. 
Detected in the Middle East, it shares many 
characteristics with Duqu and Stuxnet. Flame 
begins by sniffing the network traffic, taking 
screenshots, recording audio conversations, 
and intercepting keyboard presses. </p>






<h3>Red October:</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

 Malware used for a cyber-espionage 
campaign that has affected hundreds 
of bodies around the world – including diplomatic 
and government agencies, research 
institutions, energy and nuclear groups, and 
trade and aerospace organisations. </p>





<h2>MiniDuke: </h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Malware designed to steal data 
from government agencies and research institutions. 
Kaspersky Labs uncovered 59 
high-profile victim organisations in 23 countries, 
including Belgium, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Ukraine, 
and the US. </p>




<h3>GhostNet: </h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Malware allegedly originating in 
China which infiltrated targets in about 103 
countries, including the systems of NATO 
SHAPE headquarters, various embassies and 
foreign ministries, and the office of the Dalai 
Lama. </p>






<h3>Moonlight Maze: </h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Suspected state-sponsored 
attacks by Russian hackers targeting the 
Pentagon, the US Department of Energy, 
NASA and several universities and research 
labs. </p>


<h3>Titan Rain :</h3> 

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Suspected state-sponsored attacks 
by Chinese hackers targeting the computer 
networks of US defence contractors in 
search of military secrets. The networks of the 
British and German governments appear to 
have been targeted at the same time. </p>


<h2>Looking into the future</h2> 


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


In addition to governmental or political targets, 
state-linked hackers have also damaged private 
businesses. In 2014, the US-based security company 
Crowdstrike blamed a Chinese PLA-associated 
group 'Putter Panda' for a series of cyber-espionage 
actions directed at high-profile aerospace, satellite 
and communications targets. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

More recently, another 
group called 'Guardians of Peace' supposedly 
linked to North Korea - claimed responsibility 
for an attack on Sony Entertainment Pictures 
which resulted in the loss of personal information 
of employees and their families and the exposure 
of executive-level salaries and company email exchanges. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Available data suggest that cyber-espionage by 
state-affiliated groups is on the rise. The 2014 Data 
Breach Investigations Report by Verizon, a US telecommunications 
company, shows that 87% of all 
such incidents in 2013 (511) were performed by 
state-linked groups originating from either East 
Asia (49%) or eastern Europe (21%). </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


With state and non-state actors ever more interested 
in developing both offensive and defensive 
cyber capabilities, designing the rules of the game 
will be complicated. Authoritarian regimes enjoy 
significant freedom to set and adapt rules as they 
please. Their opponents have, alas, more limited 
options. In democratic states, governments are 
bound by the rule of law and operate under strict 
public scrutiny. Legal cooperation among like-
minded countries is moving forward, but at a very 
slow pace. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Little can be done if certain actors choose not 
to play by the rules. The US indictment of five 
Chinese military officers for cyber-espionage in 
2014 was, for example, practically ignored by 
Beijing. And the use of sanctions  - as was the case 
against North Korea following the attacks on Sony - may just aggravate the delicate situation on the 
peninsula further. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Accordingly, a preventive cyber-attack on - or 
quick retaliation against - the computer networks 
of other countries suspected of providing support 
to hackers may appear the only response capable 
of deterring future incidents.Such actions, however, 
may undermine the international system in the 
long run - and further muddy the already difficult 
international debate surrounding cyber norms. </p>
