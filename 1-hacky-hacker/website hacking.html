&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


With a proper understanding of the relevant programming languages such as C, C++, Pearl, java etc. onecan be fully equipped with the technique of hacking into website. There backdoors for the web hackersfor website hacking. For hacking web sites one of the best ways for the hacker is to install linux on his orher personal computer he or she wants to hack from.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      



Then he can open up a shell to type: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda1 and press ENTER. As the next step hewill type: dd hf= (url). There are a few other alternatives for hacking sites as well. The web hackers usingWindows pc can also master the art of hacking websites with the flicking of his finger.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


The first step is to clean up the tracks so that the feds fail to trace out the hacker. This happensautomatically in case of linux.Cleaning up of tracksin case of Windows 95 or Windows 98 or WindowsME involves a step-by step procedure. Click Start then Run and then Command. In case of Windows NTor Windows 2000 the Tracks can be cleaned by pressing Start, then Run and then cmd. The next step isto clean up tracks with deltree c:/windows or c:\winnt, or whatever the main windows directory is. Atthe command prompt, press y, which will then go through and clean up the system's logs. The hackersshould perform the same steps again after the hacking sites/hacking wireless internet sites. Then afterthis cleaning up the hackers should type: ping -l4000 (url).

<h2>Cyber Terrorism And Hacker's Group</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


The whole planet is today terrorized by the web hackers to whom hacking seems a mode of getting pleasure by the way of gaining knowledge or mere entertainment. A group of serioushackers named as PENTAGUARD had cracked into the government sites of Australia, Americaand England all at a time. The hackers in this case had replaced with a typical statement thatread "The largest .gov & .mil mass defacement in the history of mankind".</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


This was a simple statement with an aesthetic undertone of threat. The act affected almost 24sites with a transitory disruption.Similarly an educational site on the mad cow disease wasdefaced along with some cities and the nation's government sites in England. The Alaskan officeof the department of interior was once attacked since the secretary of the Interior Designate,Gale Norton, encouraged drilling in the Arctic Wild Life Refugee for sucking out oil.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


 
 
The common wealth of Australia is of no exception. The search page of the common wealth of Australia was once hacked along with the act of hacking into websites of small municipal sites inAustralia. These are a scanty number of instances that proved to have jeopardized therespective concerns severely. The hackers had to use simple techniques and methods to dothese. website hacking for these hackers is all as simple as a child's play. Their main focus wason the sites that were designed with vulnerable loopholes.</p>




<h2>SQL Injection and Hacking Web Sites</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      



 Vandals, who know how to hack, most often use hacking methods for the purpose of defacing awebsite or ruin the entire data and files while the other section cracks through the websitessimply to steal substance. While the former brings severe harm to the victim, the cyber burglarsdo not do much harm.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


There is a load of devastating tools that the web hackers use to vandalize just anything andeverything they want to. One of the most popular weapons or method that can bring immenseharm is SQL Injection. SQL - the short form of Structured Query Language is a special type of language that is used when a web application uses a database communicating with the otherdatabase for some required function.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


With the help of the SQL command issued to a database server, the web application can cast adeep impact to all the aspects of the database allowing the hackers to edit, add, and deleteinformation there from. SQL has been designed for the legitimate purpose while it has nowbecome a deadly weapon in the hand of the web hackers intended for hacking sites. The webhackers can inject SQL command and may perform any operation as per his or her own sweetwill.</p>




<h2>Cross Site Scripting</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Another more dangerous technique is Cross Site Scripting, which is also defined by XSS. This is astronger weapon that brings out much more devastation. Cross Site Scripting or XSS is adevastating technique that facilitates the hackers to inject the malicious scripting code in theform of _JavaScript in the user input form or sometimes incorporated in the URL query string.Cross Site Scripting can virtually do any task such as recording the keystrokes and stealingcookies once it is injected into the targeted browser of the end user.</p>




<h2>Distributed Denial of Service</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Denial of Service attack or Distributed Denial of Service i.e. DOS or DDOS is the attackingtechnique that is used by the hackers who wants to overload any remote system with arepeated and enormously large volume of requests for any specified service. The mostinteresting fact about the DDOS is that it can attack a several thousands of distinctive users in
 
 
such a fashion that the script fails to detect whether the requests are legitimate or illegitimate.Though it is quite tough to prevent Dos attack, yet successful efforts have been made in thisregard by checking out the IP address hacking of the source of the requests.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


There are innumerable of such tactical techniques in the hands of the web hackers for hackinginto websites. These tools have made the website hacking so easy that it has become fun forthe cyber terrorists. The first step of hacking web sites is simply to detect the feeble and lesssecured portion of the system.</p>
