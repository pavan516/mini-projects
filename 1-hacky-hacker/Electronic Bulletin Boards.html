<center><h1>Electronic Bulletin Boards Attack</h1></center>

Chat rooms and electronic bulletin boards have become breeding grounds for identity
theft. When criminals have obtained personal identifying information such as credit
card numbers or social security numbers, they visit hacker chat rooms and post
messages that they have personal information for sale.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



In April 16, 2004, a Manchester, New Hampshire man was sentenced on eight
felony counts related to a website and electronic bulletin boards where he posted for
sale thousands of Social Security Numbers and other personal information belonging
to employees of Global Crossing, as well as threats to injure or kill.</p>
