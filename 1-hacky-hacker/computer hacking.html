<h2>Black hat or White hat! Computer Hacking Explained</h2>
<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

One might not suspect that the art, or scourge, of 
computer hacking
was created at one of thehavens for technological excellence.True, at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), a group of students developed thetechnique and borrowed their name from the "hackers" of the late 1800s who foundamusement in pranking the emerging telephone companies.Getting their laughs and skills fromhacking and cracking into primitive computers and exploiting the Arpanet (predecessor to theinternet), they created a novelty that would become the target of federal crackdown in years tocome. To define hacking in short, we can say that an artistic criminal offense of breaking intoanother remote system without the owner's consent for the purpose of stealing information is hacking.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

However, the act of hacking started out innocently, and was basically a method of trying tofigure out how computer systems worked. The 1970s saw the rise in "phreaking," or phonehacking, headed by John Draper. This method allowed the user of a "blue box,", when usedwith a Captain Crunch whistle of 2600 hertz which accessed the AT&T long distance system, tomake free long distance calls. Hackers initiated with accessing the free phone calls through avaried range of sources, thereby managing to circumvent into the nation's radio system and thephoning system resulting in a tremendous phone fraud nationwide.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

After the age of "phreaking," computers became not only the target, but also the forum, for agrowing hacker population to communicate. The creation of bulletin board systems (BBS)allowed this communication and the technological possibility of more serious government andcredit card hacking became possible. At this time in the early 80's, hacking groups such as theLegion of Doom began to emerge in the United States, giving organization, and thus morepower to hackers across the country</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Once this happened, breaking into the computers became a legitimate activity, with its owngroups and soon its own voice with the 2600 magazine, launched in 1984. The effects of computer hacking were serious. Two years later, inevitably, Congress launched the ComputerFraud and Abuse Act that outlawed hacking. Over the years, there was a series of noticeable occurrences as the worst consequential effect of computer hacking on more high profile cases,such as the Morris Worm, responsible for infecting government and university systems, and the Mitnick case in 1995, which captured Kevin Mitnick, steeling as many as 20000 credit card numbers.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


In 1999, security software became widely known by the public, and with the release of newWindows programs, which were littered with security weaknesses, they became successfulbecause of necessity. This fraudulent act of computer hacking is perhaps the major problem,confronting the rapidly expanding population of Internet users today, with the systems stilltrying to battle online hackers.</p>


<h2>Computer Hacking and Cracking basics</h2>

<h3>Nuts and Bolts</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">To know what is computer hacking, one must know their terms. A list of certain significant ones isdescribed below.</p>

<h3>Hacking run</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">essentially, a hacking run is a hacking session that lasts longer than normal working times, i.e. a hackingrun that lasts for in excess of eight to ten hours.</p>

<h3>White Hat</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">considered one of nice guys, a white hat hacker is one who hacks and the informs the owner of the hacking.</p>

<h3>Black Hat</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">In contrast, the black hat hacker is considered a criminal and uses his/her skills to break the law.</p>

<h3>Gray Hat</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">As one would imagine, a gray hat hacker sometimes is good, and sometimes is criminal; a combination of the white and black hat.</p>

<h3>Script Kiddie</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">A demeaning term, used for those who hack but do so by following directions and not creating anything of their own.</p>

<h3>Trojan horse</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">Deceptive programs that pretend they do one thing, only to enter the computer system and do another;however, they need not be bad for the computer.</p>

<h3>Virus</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">A self-replicating program that inserts itself into executable codes or documents.</p>

<h3>Worm</h3>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Also a self-replicating program, but a worm breeds itself in computer systems.</p>

<h2>Software, Hardware, and Internet Hacking</h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Although the computer languages should solely be used for the legitimate purposes such as learning andother constructive purposes, yet there are lots of ways these languages are used as the means of destructions. The languages such as C, C++, java, Pearl and few more like these are used for hacking.Hackers are the programming experts who have sound grips in the language mentioned above. Thelanguage C is the utmost flexible and is the widely accepted one as the ported language in thecommunity of the hackers.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Linux is the strongest hacker-friendly operating system that can be used by the hackers intending tohack another system. The hackers use wide range software to break into the remote systems. Althoughthese programs and software were constructed for some legal purposes, yet they have turned to be theserious hacker tools. A few worth mentioning software and programs are DeCSS 1.2b, Coldlife 4.0,PCHelps Network Tracer, IntelliTamper 2.07 and etc.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Software hacking is best achieved through the use of a virus that is delivered via Internet. When a virusis loaded on the computer its affects varies within a great range -- from a trivial damage that may benegligible to a great loss by altering or wiping off the entire content of the computer hard disk.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


However, a worm nests in the hardware and is activated simply by turning on the machine in theaffected network. It has the potential to wreak havoc by crashing an entire system. Hardware hacking isa fresh new aspect that has been expanded on a new generation of tinkerers. The process of hardhacking by means of then application specific IC's ASIC is the mentionable issue. The world's business issuffering the menace of bots and the network worms.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Furthermore, hackers can alter content on a website or steal information in encrypted pages by crackingthe "code" which programs the site. The website hacking through network hacking system is anotheralternative. A bot network invasion can be launched to bring serious harm to the remote system. Thewebsites are hacked to satisfy the hacker's hunger of information and other records.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Those who engage in this are also hackers, but they specifically devote time to studying cryptography incomputers and putting this into practice. However, this is not all done by the individual. A series of mathematical functions, performed and run through computers, are used to crack the encryption of asystem that was usually made to be exceedingly difficult to figure out. All of the above can be done byemploying a careful process of reverse engineering (RE), which is simply trying to uncover thefunctioning principles of an application by "deconstructing" the way it was initially put together. Theeffect of the computer hacking is going to be more and more horrendous with the emergence more andmore advanced technology and tools.</p>



 
 <p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Hacking and cracking has become mainstream language since its beginnings in the late 60s. Today, itstands as one of the foremost concerns in computer safety and as it continues, the measures to combatit are getting increasingly more sophisticated. In this battle, sites on the Internet abound for bothhacking tutorials and ways to protect the computer. This battle against the computer hacking has to bewaged as long as computers, and the valuable information they store, are part of our lives. As an art of exploitation, hacking and cracking networks is a menace to the world of computer at the moment.</p>
