Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) is a professional designation for hackers that perform legitimate services for IT companies and other organizations. A CEH is hired to locate and repair application and system security vulnerabilities to preempt exploitations by black hat hackers and others with potentially illegal intentions. </p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Individuals that pass the CEH examination after training from an accredited training center (ATC) or self study receive the CEH designation. Self study learners must back up their qualifications with two years of practical working experience in information security (IS). Without this experience, a detailed educational background is required for review on a case-by-case basis.</p>

As of May 2012, the most current version of the exam (7) required a 70 percent passing score with 150 multiple choice questions and a four-hour limit. The cost of version 7 is $500. The cost of version 6 is $250 plus a $100 eligibility fee to cover both versions. Prices differ by territory. 

The CEH exam is administered by computer through any EC-Council ATC</p>
