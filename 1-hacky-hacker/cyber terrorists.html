<h2>Activism, Hacktivism, and Cyberterrorism: The Internet as a Tool for Influencing Foreign
Policy</h2>



<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



The purpose of this paper is to explore how the Internet is altering the landscape of political
discourse and advocacy, with particular emphasis on how it is used by those wishing to influence
foreign policy. Emphasis is on actions taken by nonstate actors, including both individuals and
organizations, but state actions are discussed where they reflect foreign policy decisions triggered
by the Internet. The primary sources used in the analysis are news reports of incidents and events.
These are augmented with interviews and survey data where available. A more scientific study
would be useful.<br>

Affecting Trust : Terrorism, Internet and Offensive Information Warfare</p>

The national security consequences of the potential use of the Internet by terrorist organizations
have attracted the interest of many academics and government and intelligence officials. The goal
of this article is to provide a new explanatory angle concerning the possible targets of terrorists'
offensive information warfare (OIW) operations. It argues that these organizations may prove
more valuable and effective to undermine on-line activities of leading electronic commerce sites
than to target elements of the critical national information infrastructure. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



These offensive actions,
in fact, would directly impact one of the explanatory elements for the Internet's success : users'
perception of its trustworthiness. Before tackling its arguments, the article provides a definition of
offensive information warfare. Then, it investigates how terrorist organizations would formulate
their operational style concerning offensive information warfare. The stage is then set to define
the central argument of the article by drawing from studies carried out in the areas of information
security, international management and electronic commerce. </p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



The article concludes with a set of
policy recommendations to counter these potential threats and thus make the Internet a safer
communication instrument for economic, commercial and social development.</p>

Governments and critical infrastructures rely increasingly on network computing technologies
and are thus ever more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Responding to such attacks - whether through
diplomatic or economic sanctions, cyber-counterattack, or physical force - raises legal questions.
International customary law is not yet fully formed on this issue, but the UN Charter and the laws
of armed conflict establish certain baseline rules. </p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Countries with a stake in evolving legal
standards for the use of force in information operations should be prepared to make hard choices.
Such countries should aim not only to preserve their own security, but also to set legal precedents
that balance the need to use a new kind of force against the considerable, untested risks of doing
so.

This paper discusses the definition of cyberterrorism, its potential, and suggests an approach to
the minimization of its'dangers. The definition of cyberterrorism used in this paper is combines
the United States Department of State's definition of terrorism as politically motivated acts of
violence against non-combatants with a definition of cyberspace as the computers, networks,
programs and data which make up the information infrastructure. The conclusion is that by
limiting the physical capabilities of the information infrastructure, we can limit it potential for
physical destruction.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp





The vulnerability of the critical infrastructure has led to increasing concern that it will be the
target of terrorist attacks. This article explores definitional aspects of information terrorism and
identifies two groups likely to find information terrorism attractive : conventional terrorism
groups and information culture groups.</p>
