<h2>Cell phones - Hackers Next Target!</h2>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         



It was bound to happen - they have hacked just about everything else. Now it's the cell phones.Cellphone hacking has just recently surfaced and been made public ever since some one did somecellular phone hacking on Paris Hilton's cell phone.This article will give you some information about what is going on out there and what you can do tobetterprotect your cell phone information.</p>


<h3>What Does It Involve</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


The fact of someone hacking cell phone became public knowledge when Paris Hilton's cell phone, alongwith her information was recently hacked. Unfortunately for her, all her celebrity friends and theirphone numbers were also placed on the Internet - resulting in a barrage of calls to each of them.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


Cell phone hackers have apparently found a glitch in the way the chips are manufactured. The goodnews, though, is that it only applies to the first generation models of cell phones that use the GlobalSystem for Mobile communications (GSM). Another requirement is that the hacker must have physicalaccess to the cell phone for at least three minutes - which is a real good reason not to let it out of yoursight. Currently, although the problem has been remedied (at least for now) in the second and thirdgeneration phones, it seems that about 70% of existing cell phones fall within the first generationcategory.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


Another way that mobile phone hacking can take place is for a hacker to walk around an area withpeople that have cell phones and a laptop that has cellphone hacker programs on it. Through anantenna, and a little patience, his computer can literally pick up your cell phone data - if it is turned on.This is more applicable to cell phones that use Bluetooth technology.</p>





<h2>What Can A Hacker Do?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       
    
Surprisingly, there are quite a number of things that can be accomplished by the hacker. Depending ontheir intent here are a few of them.</p>

 
<h3>Steal Your Number</h3>

 <p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       
 Your phone number can be accessed and obtained by cellphone hacking. This allows them tomake calls and have it charged to your account.</p>

 
<h3>Take Your Information</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

Mobile hacking allows a hacker to contact your cell phone, without your knowledge, and todownload your addresses and other information you might have on your phone. Many hackersare not content to only get your information. Some will even change all your phone numbers!Be sure to keep a backup of your information somewhere. This particular technique is called Bluesnarfing.</p>



<h2>Be Prepared for Cell Phone Hacks</h2>

 
<h3>Rob Your Money</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       


Other options might use a particular buying feature called SMS. This refers to the fact thatmoney can be taken from your account and transferred into another- and a good hacker can sit in one place and access a lot of phones and transfer a lot of moneyrather quickly - probably in less time than you think!</p>

 
<h3>Give The System A Virus</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       


By using another cell phone hack code, a hacker could kidnap your phone, send it a camouflagedprogram or send it a virus. But it does not end there, since, from that point, he can use yourphone to retransmit the virus to many other phones almost instantly - potentially disabling thesystem.</p>

 
<h3>Spy On You</h3>
<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       


A hacker can also gain access and take over for cell phone spying and remote mobile phonehacking. Literally, once secured, the hacker can have the phone call him, and then be able tolisten to all conversations going on around the owner of the phone.</p>

 
<h3>Access Your Voice Mails</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

Voice mails can also be retrieved by a hacker through a hacking cell phone. After stealing yournumber, this can easily be done - if your password is disabled. The main thing that needs to beunderstood here, is that the electronics that give you the modern convenience of interactingwith the Internet (getting your voice mails, emails, Web surfing, etc.) , is also the sametechnology that allows you to receive the same ills as can befall someone on the Internet.</p>


<h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
 

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

 It seems that the major cell phone companies, at least at this point, really are not interested in bringingthe system up to be able to cope with this threat. Meetings are starting to take place, but for now it isnot perceived to be real serious. This could be because it is primarily the older phones that are mostsusceptible to some types of this mobile hacking.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

Until the cell phone manufacturers are able to cope with, or eliminate, the glitches in the system thatallows them to overcome these problems, you will largely have to help yourself to cope with thesethings. Here are a couple of tips that will help you protect your cell phone, its information, and other things.</p>


 
<h3>Use Your Passwords</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

The cell phone companies tell us that many people have turned off their passwords when theyaccess their voice mail messages, or other things. This little feature, though it may seem to be anannoyance to some, could protect your phone from unauthorized purposes.</p>

 
<h3>Leave The Phone Off </h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

This one is obviously the harder choice, here, simply because most of us who have cell phoneslike to be reached anytime and anywhere. Others do need to be reachable at all times.</p>

 
<h3>Upgrade Your Phone</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       


While this cannot guarantee that your phone is not hackable, it certainly will help. It should beremembered that the phone companies work hard to deliver the best technology andconveniences - but the cell phone hacks work just as hard to be the first to break the systemsdesigned to defeat them. It is an ongoing battle.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

Cellular phone hacking, for now, is a fact of life that affects a few of us. Gladly, the numbers arestill small, but many feel this problem is just getting started. By being aware of the problems,you can wisely take steps to prevent them from happening to you. Cellphone hacking does notneed to catch you unprepared.
