Everyone has heard of one individual or another that was caught while hacking computers that belonged to this or that organization. Because hacking into computers is highly illegal, it should bementioned that this article will not mention any real specifics about the subject, and this author wouldrather gladly encourage you to become a real hacker - professionally.This article, will however, give a brief overview of criminal hackers, some of their methods, and a fewthings you can do to make your own computer safer from hack attacks. Here are those things you needto learn on how to become a hacker.</p>

<h3> learn Computers</h3>
<p style="font-size:140%;">It should go without saying that the first thing that is needed is to learn about computers. This means study. A lot of reading is involved along with just plain old-fashioned learning how to usea computer. Then, of course, there are the special aspects of computer study. The places wherethe tips are learned is often two-fold: a friend who has access to a computer, and a variety of places on the Web. But this is also an interesting thing - if a young person has the ability tolearn, and wants to learn can use hacking tutorials- then why not take the time to learn the rightthings - things that can earn him a lot of money in the legit world? Is it possibly that it could bethe friend he has that turns him away from the good?</p>


<h2>Search for tools on Hackers Websites and forums</h2>

 
<h3>Learn The Websites</h3>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Special hacker Web sites, where hackers congregate, exist on the Web - as does every otherknown group of people - whether legal or illegal. Some of these are known to be hacker chatrooms, hacker forum, and regular hacker sites.</p>

 
 
 
<h3>Learn The Secrets</h3>
<p style="font-size:140%;">It is in these Web sites, and possibly some of the people that he may meet, maybe only online,where he will learn the hacking basics, and learn how to hack.</p>

<h2>Tools Hackers Need To Get Into Websites</h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">

 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Some of the tools that a hacker may use are often varied and constantly changing. One such tool thatwas used last year allowed a hacker to gain control of the computers of those who simply mistyped theword Google - when trying to get the popular search engine. This automatically directed them to aspecial website that would give them such malware items as Trojan downloaders, backdoors andspyware2. Another tool would be the robot spider. These can be sent out and put on automatic and will look forports of access into your computer. These spiders are running around all the time and some say thatthey may hit most computers that are online - up to 50 times a day.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Other tools use email attachments. It is claimed that as much as 65% of all email is spam. And as muchas 1 in about 30 emails contains a virus, or some form of malware. This is why having your own virus andspam protection is a must, as well as a good spyware remover. Someone is busy. Once someone hasbeen hacking information on a computer they will often leave a Trojan file that will give them furtheraccess - often more than one file. Then they could use your computer to send out spam attacks -without you even knowing that it is taking place. Or, they could simply be hacking your personalinformation off of your computer. These are just a few of their tools.</p>


<h2>How Hackers Avoid Getting Caught</h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">

One of the first things that someone would learn about hacking tutorials when studying to be a hacker is how to cover their tracks. Of course, some are better than others. A young hacker is less likely to know all the little things that an expert hacker might know. Besides, the young hacker may be trying to impress others - and get a little careless about covering his tracks. This is why younger hackers are often caught.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


An older hacker, on the other hand, will rarely leave any tracks. They know how to use their victim'scomputers as a tool for a launching place to get into another computer - leaving a phony IP address.The truth is, and it is a good thing, that computer programmers are getting better software, andhardware (firewalls) that are constantly doing a better job - both in keeping hackers out, and inrecording IP addresses better for tracking purposes.There will always be hackers, and there will always be hackers in prison. The legislation is definitelyturning against the hacker - with some hacking crimes becoming equal to terrorism, these days.</p>

KevinMitnick, a well-known hacker, had the Federal prosecutors accuse him of having caused $291 million indamages to corporate computers. A serious crime, and he remains in jail because of it - unable to touchanymore computers.Even by learning some of the wrong type of hacking basics through hacking tutorials, a young personcould start down a wrong path. Hacking computers, though often glorified on TV, is still criminal.</p>
