<h2>Hacker's beware: A Crook is Caught One Day or the other</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

Hackers had broken into the Department of Defense's computers - again. With news like this,combined with the fact that other hackers are
 constantly seeking to steal people's identity,send out spam from innocent computers, and other computer crimes hacking intounauthorized places,makes
 it necessary for illegal hackers to be caught. If you are one of those who have sufferedfrom a hack attack, then you may be one of those who say:
 "I need an IP specialist, to catch ahacker." This article will show you some things that you can do.</p>





<h2>How Hackers Are Caught</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



With the fact that Microsoft and some other software companies have been notified - yes,
 byhackers, that there are many "holes" in Windows that a hacker can take advantage of.Microsoft has responded by
 attempting to fix the "holes" each time one is pointed out. Then, itsends out a patch to block hackers from attacking through that "hole".</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

 Keeping up with theupdate's from Microsoft is one way to close down the problems that exist in the Windowssoftware - though it
 is unknown if all such "holes" will ever be known.Normally, it is rather hard to notice that a hacker has hacked into your computer. 
If all he isdoing is having a look around, or taking minimum amounts of data - you really cannot be surethat you are being hacked.
 The are some effects of computer hacking, though, that might tipyou off. Here are a couple of ways to detect hackers.</p>



<h2>Detecting Hackers</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Hackers, by nature are very stealthy. Their ability to gain access to your computer through theInternet can easily be done without your knowledge - and most of them seem to prefer thatapproach. Before time is spent on being able to detect a hacker, it should be noted that adetermined hacker will not be stopped! They will get in - even to the Department of Defensessystems!</p>


<h3>Some common things that might tip you off to an intrusion are:</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">


 
Lights showing hard drive activity being busier than what your own activities call for.<br>

 
Suspicious files left on your computer - often in the Windows Temp directory with atmp. suffix<br>

Obvious tampering - destroyed files, missing files, etc.<br>

 


 
Or, the worst case - someone's taking money out of your bank account or using yourcredit cards
 (Please note, though, that this could also be &nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe result of phishing, too - notnecessarily hacking)<br>

 
Your firewall keeps receives multiple packets from a single web address and notifiesyou.</p>




<h2>How to catch a hacker</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Once a hacker does gain access to your computer, he will purposefully leave a little file or two,that will give him easy access in the future. 
These files are usually referred to as "trojans." Thisis one of the facts about hackers that is not very comforting.Even after you take precautions to
 prevent further attacks, unless you thoroughly clean off thehacker's little access files - he can still easily access your system. </p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Another not so nice fact is that,unless you really learn (or already know) about computer systems, you probably will not eitherbe able to detect,
 or stop the hacker. You can, however, get help. This is when you need to say,"I need an IP specialist, to catch a hacker".</p>






<h2>Tracing The Hacker's IP Address</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


A number of software programs are available now - through the Internet, that will enable youto trace a hacker's
 IP address to a geographical address. Remember, though, that hackers oftenborrow other computers (usually unknown to the owner),
 and do their computer crimeshacking from there. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


So, before you take any action against someone you think it might be, it isbetter to let the proper authorities handle it.
One free program that you might use in order to learn of the hacker's IP address is Netstat.

 This Windows program will enable you to see exactly what the hacker does - tracing everything.It also shows you the status of all of
 your ports, and other statistics.</p>





<h2>Catching Them Red-Handed</h2>



<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Basically once there is a hacker attack, you have two options. The first is to shut your systemdown, and give your computer to a lab to be able to collect 
the necessary evidence. Apart fromthe aforementioned programs, if you do much to the computer yourself - you could bedestroying the very evidence you need 
to track a hacker. Of course, if you have not alreadybacked up your data elsewhere, this option may not be available to you. Remember that ahacker can only be
 prosecuted using the evidence on other people's computers. </p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


A secondcourse of action would be to act as if nothing had taken place, and move your sensitive data toanother computer. 
By leaving it alone, and letting the hacker continue, more evidence can becollected against him until there is a solid case.
 Knowing this fact about how to catch a hacker is

 
 
very important.Besides needing an IP address, you must also learn the ISP from which the attack comes. Port43 will give you data about the IP and the ISP. 
Software is available that can tell you thesethings, and you can also learn about it by going to a whois directory.
 Then, with thisinformation, you can contact the Webmaster of the ISP, and hopefully, get it stopped.</p>




<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Each of us needs to take some serious precautions about preventing our own computers frombeing broken into (as much as possible).
 With the software and firewalls that are currentlyavailable, perhaps you will never need to be one who cries out, "I need a specialist, to catch ahacker". 
After you get the necessary programs to make your computer safer, be sure to keep itupdated, and prevent computer crimes hacking.</p>
