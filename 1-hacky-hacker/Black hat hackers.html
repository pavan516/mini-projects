Thanks to Hollywood, black hat hackers have become the iconic image of all hackers around theworld. For the majority of computer users, the word hacker has become a synonym for socialmisfits and criminals. Of course, that is an injustice created by our own interpretation of themass media, so it is important for us to learn what a hacker is and what a black hacker (orcracker) does. So, let's learn about black hat techniques and how they make our lives a littlemore difficult.</p>



<h2>What Is Black Hat Hacking?</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

A black hat hacker, also known as a cracker or a dark side hacker (this last definition is a directreference to the Star Wars movies and the dark side of the force), is someone who uses hisskills with a criminal intent. Some examples are: cracking bank accounts in order to maketransferences to their own accounts, stealing information to be sold in the black market, orattacking the computer network of an organization for money.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Some famous cases of black hat hacking include Kevin Mitnick, who used his black hat hackersskills to enter the computers of organizations such as Nokia, Fujitsu, Motorola and SunMicrosystems (it must be mentioned that he is now a white hat hacker); Kevin Poulsen, whotook control of all the phone lines in Los Angeles in order to win a radio contest (the prize was aPorsche 944 S2); and Vladimir Levin, which is the handle of the mastermind behind the stealingof $10'000,000 to Citigroup.</p>




<h2>Differences Between White Hat And A Black Hat Hacker</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The difference between black hat and white hat hackers is that white hat hacker uses their skillsand knowledge as a way to defend someone from attackers. That means that white hat hackersoffer their services to corporations, public organizations and educational institutions.These services include a complete revision of their computer network security, implementationof new security systems (they may be hardware or software), user training and future

 

recommendations. All these measures will be able to combat unauthorized hacking; black hathackers, however, will continue trying.</p>







<h2>How To Defeat The Attempts Of A Black Hat Hacker</h2>



<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


In order to survive in the World Wide Web, there are certain things that we need to know inorder to endure. The first one is that each computer user is responsible for his machine and thedata that it contains. It doesn't matter if a transnational spends hundreds of millions of dollarsin IT security if an absent-minded employee downloads and installs unauthorized software orfalls into the email scheme of black hat hackers.</p>


<h3>
Basic Knowledge</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


So, the first thing that we need to know is that computers, and networks, are like houses. If they don't have the windows and doors properly secured, anyone can enter. There arethousands of hackers in the internet looking for computers with unsecured entrances. Evenworse, they have programs making the search for them. If you consider that there are hundredsof millions of computers in the world, then it is highly probable that an important percentage of them aren't properly secured.</p>





<h3>Firewall</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


In order to secure our "house", we need to have a firewall installed and properly configured. Afirewall is like a lock that assures that all the entrances to your computer are properly closed, sono one from the outside can access it.</p>




<h3>Anti Virus Software</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Another useful piece of software is the antivirus. Antivirus have been around since the firstpersonal computers since viruses have always existed. Unfortunately, the internet hasgenerated a demographic explosion and now they wander, freely, through the net. There areseveral software packages in the market, so test the ones with which you feel morecomfortable and stay with the one that is more convenient for you.</p>







<h3>Regular Updates</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



The next step is to update your operating system, especially if it is Windows XP. Ninety percentof the worldwide operating system market is owned by Microsoft. For that reason, it is thepreferred choice for crackers in the entire world. They are constantly looking for ways to bypassthe security of this operating system, looking for weaknesses of all kind (even in something asinnocent as the Media Player). In order to stop them, maintain your operating system updated.</p>
 
 
<h2>Education in Security Techniques</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Finally, if you are inside a company, assure yourself that the users are trained. They must beable to detect if they are being victims of cracker scam. It can be through the internetmessaging system, an email or even an innocent looking PowerPoint attachment sent by afriend. People are the last line of defense against black hat hacking.Over time, black hat techniques have become more advanced and complex.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



 Although there arecomputer software programs that can help a cracker in many ways, it is still a profession thatrequires a knack for computer software and hardware. So, as you may have noticed, black hathackers will never disappear, which means that we need to have our computers, and ournetworks, prepared.</p>
