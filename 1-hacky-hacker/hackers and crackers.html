<h2>
Outlaws of Technology! Hacker or Cracker</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


In order to study the comparison the between the hackers and crackers, it is important tounderstand the respective definitions. While apparently the words hacking and cracking seemssynonymous, yet there exist certain points of distinctions between the two and the meaning of the words will always be heated topics of debate.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Since the very dawn of the civilization, man's hunger to attain the unattainable have went onopening new horizons in almost every aspects of life, and the technology is of no exception to this nature of human.</p>



<h2>Aims of Hackers and Crackers</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The computer hackers actually trespass or circumvent artistically, yet scientifically into theother computer system with a hunger to know the programmable systems, how they performand their internal structures, while cracking is slight different in sense. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Cracking means to breakoff the computer's security system. This is a subject matter of hard-core science with anaesthetic undertone of artistic skill that has attracted a few millions of teenagers and youngadults all over the world.</p>


<h2>Who Is A Hacker And What Is His Aim?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Delving deep into the concepts, we can compare the hackers and crackers. A hacker is a personwho commits the fraudulent act or the penal offense of exploring into the other computers inorder to know the details of the programmable system and how they work. On the other level,a cracker is a person just more secretive as compared to the hacker. The cracker breaks throughthe system's security and proves to be far more dangerous than the hackers who just quenchhis or her thirst by simply discovering the workings of a system.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Hence the crackers can potentially be much more perilous as compared to the hackers.
 While itis often believed that the hacking is simply exploring into the other computer system with anintention to know how the programmable system works, which is not a fraudulent task unlessany sort of vandalism and theft is done by this, another huge section stands strictly against theview and look at the act from the view point of a crime.</p>





<h2>Who is A Cracker and What Is His Aim?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


A cracker is a technical person who has mastered the art of breaking systems, often not foracquiring knowledge, by the dint of few programs and softwares used as tools. They are moreinterested in the system's security without the need of great deal of knowledge, thereby not

 
 
benefiting much.On the other hand, a hacker who cracks and hacks systems is not only interested in breakingthe security of the system but also in knowing about the system's details, by which he gainsmuch more than by simply cracking systems. Unlike a cracker, a hacker generally does not haveintention destroy data maliciously or to steel things.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

A cracker who is often termed to be a cyber burglar brings out significant harm to the networkor steels the information like passwords or credit card numbers. A Trojan is capable enough torecognize and record even every single keystroke that you make. Hence even if you do notstore any personal or financial records in your system, the hackers can still be able to obtain theinformation by recognizing the keystrokes.

<h2>Prerequisites of Hackers and Crackers</h2>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Hacking and cracking are not as easy as they apparently appear to be. These need seriousendeavor to the exhaustive studies and thorough understanding of the computer languages.Both the hackers and crackers must be highly dedicated programming experts who must havesound grips of the language C, as this language has the utmost flexibility and is the widely usedported language all over world's hackers' communities.Other helpful languages are C++, java and pearl.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



 By the dint of such technical know-how thehackers becomes smart enough to compel another computer system or a program or any otherpiece of hardware to perform such things that they actually were not wanted to do. Thecrackers tries to gain a hassle free access to a system or a server with the help of certainmethodical tools that bypasses the security, giving the crackers immense privileges with theserver or the system they have targeted.</p>




<h2>The Legal Aspect</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Whatever the terminology may be - an act of hacking or cracking, both the ideas have been brought tothe severe penal action irrespective of the reasons. Although it seems to be an enjoyable task of exploring out to visit into the other computer systems by breaking off the system's security, yetcomputer hacking is treated to be a fraudulent and a criminal offense that has been covered under theserious legal section of Title 18:</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Crimes and Criminal Procedure: Part 1: Crimes: Chapter 47: Fraud and False Statements: Section 1030:Fraud and related activity in connection with computers. However needless to say that, hacking andcracking are such acts that is illegal in some ways but to view from the certain other platform the act hasbeen found to serve some agencies and departments with certain awfully useful functions - beyondmere pleasure. </p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Though illegal, the hackers and the crackers are sometimes used by the nations' top
 
 20ranking departments for hacking and cracking networks to get the information that may be required tosave the nation from any anticipated danger.
