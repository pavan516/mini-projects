<h2>Hacking Simplified – For Those Who Want to Learn Things Fromthe Scratch</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


It's quite probable that you have received spam offering a hotmail hacking guide that will giveyou the basics on how to become a hacker. Although it sounds tempting to have the power toknow the private life of other persons, most of these guides and courses are nothing butscamsthat are looking for new victims.If you really want to become a hacker, you need to go to the places were they gather: a hackingfacebook, a hacker's forum, free hacking tutorials or even a mailing list. The information is outthere. You only need to go and find it.</p>



<h2>Where Can You Get Material on Hacking and Information on Hacking</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp




There are two main sources. The first one is the Internet. You will have to make a basic query inyour favorite search engine with the word hacker and start looking each one of the suggestedsites. Most of them will only offer you limited tutorials on how to hack (like the Hacker's Blackbook or the Happy Hacker book, which are outdated). Other's will give you an useful insight onthis world. After some time, you will find forums were people from around the world sharetheir experiences.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Do not expect to enter an easy world. The jargon used by a group of hackers can be quiteconfusing for any beginner. So don't feel that you will never be part of it. Start with the basicsand read "How to become a hacker" from Eric S. Rymond. Although the document is five yearsold, it will give you an introductory crash course on were do you need to start.</p>

 
 <p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The second source is face to face reunions. Get into the internet and
search for any hacker's
meeting in your vicinity. You will be surprised to find that they meet quite regularly. Of course, do notexpect to find a Matrix kind of reunion. This is serious, professional people that pay their rentby hacking. Drop by and make some questions on hacking tutorials.</p>


<h3>What Is The Hackers Bible?</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The hacker's bible has two possible sources, depending on whom do you ask. For some people,it is none other but the magazine 2600: The Hacker Quarterly. This magazine was created byEmmanuel Goldstein, and it focuses on aspects of different technologies. For example, it coverstelecommunication devices as well as computers.The magazine gives to its readers grey hacker's material. That means that it gives theminformation on how to augment the capacities of any electronic apparatus, such as a cellphone. This neutral posture is different to white hacking (were a hacker uses his abilities for agood cause, like detecting the vulnerabilities of a network) and black hacking (were a hackeruses his knowledge for selfish purposes, like creating a hotmail hacking guide).</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



The other Hacker's Bible is the Jargon File. This document is a glossary of hacker slang that hasbeen collected since 1975, from the old days of the Arpanet (the precursor of the Internet).</p>




<h2>Are There Any Hacking Facebook Or Forums That Can Help YouIdentify The Latest Threats In Hacking?</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Fortunately, yes. You only need to input the words hack and forum in your favorite searchengine and you will find lots of sites were the latest threats are discussed. But be careful. As itwas stated in a previous paragraph, the hacker slang can be quite a hieroglyphic for a newbie.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


If you find a forum or an IRC chat were hackers discuss their experiences and giverecommendations, make sure that you understand them. If you don't, then you should take astep backward and return to the web pages where they give introductory advice to beginners.</p>



<h2>Can You Really Become A Hacker With The Material Or Will You Land In Jail?</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



You can become a hacker with the material found inside the internet without spending your life in jail.As it was mentioned before, a hacker has three choices: white, grey and black hacking. As a white hackeryou may be able to offer your services to different businesses as a freelancer; you will be able to showthem any vulnerability in their systems.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



 
 As a grey hacker you stand in the thin line between good and evil. Although you will not end in jail forthis type of activity, you could end in the "dark side" before you even notice it. In case you cross thisboundary, then you will be considered a nuisance to society, and could finish with a restriction to usecomputers (besides a huge fine and a term in prison, of course).</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Hacking is not for everyone. You need the skills, the patience and the knowledge for mastering this art. If you feel that you have what it takes to become a hacker, then start with a hacking facebook. Read itcompletely. As a matter of fact, devour it. Hacking requires a lot of reading so better to get accustomedto it. So, forget about that hotmail hacking guide and start doing real hacker's stuff.</p>
