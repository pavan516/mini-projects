<h2>Are You Sure Your Password is Safe?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Since the appearance of computers and the necessity of storing confidential information, passwordsbecame part of our lives. But password hacking programs also appeared; as a ready to offer asolutionfor those hackerswho were stopped by this barrier. At first, these programs were distributed betweencertain underground hacker groups.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


But when the internet appeared, anyone could find programs for password hacking; passwordshackers popularized few softwares and soon it became mainstream among the computercommunity. Any user can insert the keywords 'how to hack a password' in any search enginesand he will find tons of information that can help him.</p>



<h2>Passwords and How to Obtain Them</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


A password is a combination of characters that a user uses for protecting information. Once afile or a determined section of a hard disk is protected by a password, only those that know itcan access it. Although passwords have existed for thousands of years, they have adaptedperfectly to the computer era.If you consider how much money you can make for knowing the correct combination of characters of a determined portal, then it is no wonder that password hackers proliferated.</p>



<h2>How Hacking Of Passwords Is Achieved</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      



Password hacks can be performed in several ways. The most common used tool is socialengineering. Social engineering consists in making a user believe that he is giving confidentialinformation to a trusted party. For example, a cracker could pose as a system administratorfrom another country and ask for some personal information that could be consideredirrelevant by the user. It's quite probable that that information was the last piece of the puzzlerequired by the cracker for acquiring the password of the user.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Another way of hacking passwords is through a hash function. A hash function is a program thattransforms a determined password into a fixed length string. For example, if you have thepassword foxtrot1256, the hash function will transform it into a key, something like

 
 
DG65HKSDLK43545SSDFEE232AQQQ10. Some programs use determined artifices for findingthe password hidden inside the key.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      



Since computing power increased, the brute force attack became another choice for cracking passwords. How does it work? Well, it basically tests different kinds of character combinationsuntil it finds the correct one. The problem with this method is that if the password is too long,then the brute force attack won't prosper, at least during a reasonable spam of time. In thiskind of situations, it is better to use social engineering to find out the password.</p>




<h2>Password Hacking: Programs and Tools Make it Easy</h2>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Dictionary attacks are another technique among password hacking programs. It is moresophisticated than a brute force attack but not as complex as a hash function passwordprogram. Although it could be considered similar to a brute force attack, the main differencebetween these two is that a dictionary attack uses determined words, hoping that the creatorof the password used words that can be found in any dictionary. It may sound a bit foolish butreality has shown that people are not very careful with their passwords.</p>


<h2>What Are the Tools Available For Password Hacking</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


There are many password hack tools available in the internet. Some of them are free, othersare available for a small fee. For example, there is Rainbowcrack. This tool was created forcracking hash passwords through brute force; it may not be very sophisticated, but it does the job.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      



Another example is LC5 (formerly known as L0phtCrack). It recovers Microsoft Windowspasswords using dictionaries, brute force or a combination of both. Unfortunately, it won't beavailable after 2006 since Symantec acquired it.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      



John the Ripper is another password cracking tool, and can run in a series of platforms. Considered oneof the most popular password hacking programs, it combines different cracker programs into onepackage. It uses the dictionary attack for searching hash passwords and also has a brute force mode.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      



Another Windows recovery tool is Cain and Abel. This software package uses a series of tools forpassword recovery, like dictionary, brute force and cryptanalysis attacks (that means that it looks for akey for accessing the password, something like the password's password).</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      


Rixler Software is a company who offers a service of password cracking for different kind of programs,like Word, Excel, Access, VBA, Outlook Express and Internet Explorer. They offer personal and businesslicenses, depending on your needs.</p>

 Brutus is considered by its creator one of the fastest and more flexible password crackers in the market.The good thing about this tool is that it is a free password hacker. The bad thing is that it is only availablefor Windows 9x, NT and 2000.Password hacking, passwords hackers, password protection, it doesn't matter which of those conceptsare wandering through your head. </p>

If you want to be able to hack passwords, let's say, for some clientwho forgot his recently changed password, then you will have to practice a bit and maintain yourself updated on the latest trend of password hacking programs.</p>
