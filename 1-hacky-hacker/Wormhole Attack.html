<h2>Routing Protocols and Wormhole Attack</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Many routing protocols are available for MANET. In this
section, some of the frequently used routing protocols are
reviewed and the threat of wormhole attacks to such protocols
is considered. These routing protocols can be categorized into
two types: table-driven/proactive and demand-driven/reactive
. DSDV, OLSR and SEAD are proactive routing protocols;
while DSR, AODV and Ariadne are reactive routing
protocols.


<h2>Wormholes and Its Variants</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



This paper focuses on the wormhole attack, where two
colluding nodes that are far apart are connected by a tunnel
giving an illusion that they are neighbors. Each of these nodes
receive route request and topology control messages from the
network and send it to the other colluding node via tunnel
which will then replay it into the network from there. </p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



By using
this  additional tunnel, these nodes are able to advertise that
they have the shortest path through them. Once this link is
established, the attackers may choose each other as multipoint
relays (MPRs), which then lead to an exchange of some
topology control (TC) messages and data packets through the
wormhole tunnel. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Since these MPRs forward flawed topology
information, it results in spreading of incorrect topology
information throughout the network . On receiving this
false information, other nodes may send their messages
through them for fast delivery. Thus, it prevents honest
intermediate nodes from establishing links between the source
and the destination . Sometimes, due to this, even a
wormhole attacker may fall victim to its own success. </p>




<h2>Prevention of Wormhole Attack</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Choietal.in is considered that all the nodes will monitor the
behavior of its neighbors. Each node will send RREQ
messages to destination by using its neighbor list. If the source
does not receive back the RREP message within a stipulated
time, it detects the presence of wormhole and adds the route to
its wormhole list.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp





 Each node maintains a neighbor node table
which contains a RREQ sequence number, neighbor node ID,
sending time and receiving time of the RREQ and count. Here
the source node sets the Wormhole Prevention Timer (WPT)
after sending RREQ packet and wait until it overhears its
neighbor's retransmission.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp





 According to the author, the
maximum amount of time required for a packet to travel
one-hop distance is WPT/2. Therefore, the delay per hop value
must not exceed estimated WPT. However, the proposed
method does not fully support DSR as it is based on end-to-end
signature authentication of routing packets.</p>
