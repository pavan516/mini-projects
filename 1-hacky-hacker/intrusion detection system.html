The stories go on and on about another individual having their personal information stolen from theircomputer by some hacker. While it is true that hackers do get people's information, and they will keepon getting that information, it is also true that having intrusion detection software can help. And evenbetter, to be hacker safe intrusion prevention system is by the same software.</p>



<h2>Why You Need Intrusion Detection</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

Doors can be opened to hackers in varied ways. Two of the most common ways by which they can gainaccess to your computer is simply through emails, or Web pages that you visit that have spyware, ortrojans (a file which looks innocent, but actually will later open doors to a hacker) attached to them.Other ways are robot spiders sent out over the Internet to find unprotected computers, and open doors.Some say that every computer attached to the Internet may be attacked by such a spider as many as 50times each day. So, if you do not have an intrusion prevention system in place, up-to-date, then you mayhave regular unexpected visitors - and you may not even know it. Others say that 9 out of 10 computershave some sort of spyware, or malware on them. Could you be one of them? This article will show youwhat is available on the market for your protection - and much of it can be obtained for free.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The spider robots work automatically - looking for and identifying computers on the Internet that havedoors, or ports, open to them. This information is then reported back to the hacker - knowing whichcomputers to target - and which port to use. For this reason, every now and then, Microsoft will comeout with a new patch for Windows, in order to close some faulty door that hackers have discovered andbeen using.</p>



<h2>What Is Intrusion Detection?</h2>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Network Intrusion detection software is a must-have these days. Each company's software will varysomewhat (for copyright and originality purposes), but you do need one for your own network, or homecomputer. It differs from a firewall in that the purpose of a firewall is to stop unauthorized external

 
 contacts with your system. These offer hacker prevention largely for contacts from outside the network.Most of these will now notify the owner or network controller of intrusion attempts. Network intrusiondetection systems, on the other hand, will give you warnings about events that take place within thenetwork itself.</p>



<h2>Be Hacker Safe Use Intrusion Detection Systems</h2>

Although they are excellent in their design, having a basic firewall by itself is not sufficient toprovide hacker prevention. Detection firewall intrusion often takes place after the fact. Animportant note here would be that a firewall cannot remove things that are already on yourcomputer or network. If there was a virus before, or trojans, they will still be there afterwards.Which brings up another point - the first thing that needs to be done, before installing anyfirewall or intrusion detection software, is to remove all malware from the system by using agood scanner and removal software program. At the present time, there are a number of themthat are free. It might be a good idea to run more than one - but be sure to disable the one youare not using. Experience shows that different software will detect different malware.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

When selecting your intrusion detection software, you need to know that there are basicallytwo kinds. One is passive, meaning that an alarm will be sounded. A second kind is active,meaning that it will terminate the communication with the computer trying to obtain access,and it will notify the Webmaster. Intrusion detection software can also stop phishing emails,spam, and those pop-up ads. They can also prevent dial up hacker from invading your system.</p>

Keeping your system hacker safe, and knowing how to prevent hackers from doing their dirtywork is an ongoing task. It was mentioned in the beginning of the article that a determinedhacker will get information. They are constantly upgrading their own methods, and the sadthing, is that much of the intrusion prevention development going on, only seeks to keep upwith the methods the hackers use. The result - a hacker comes up with a new method, and -he'll get in.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

One thing that is being reported as working quite well, especially for a Unix system (althoughthere is also a Windows version, too), is an intrusion detection using Snort with wincap. Thisprogram has good reviews, and may be the software you need. Because of competition, newand better programs of detection and prevention are being developed all the time. Somesystems have firewalls just for spam filters (great for email servers), and ones for general systems. There is even a new firewall system out there that is just for in-house IMcommunications. Of course, these new systems try to combine some of the features of afirewall and an intrusion detection system into one great package - and some of them can even
 
 
remove existing malware on your system!</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The best advice that could be given is to take this information and begin to do your ownresearch into the latest products on intrusion prevention. At the same time you will want tofind good malware removal software, and don't forget to consider downloading a trial versionfirst. Some of these offer complete systems that can even be upgraded daily for the length of the trial period. Having your system protected by intrusion detection software is a great move,and will help to bring greater security to the information you want guarded the most.</p>
