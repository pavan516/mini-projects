<h2>Hackers and Culture? True Indeed!</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Hacker culture has existed for many decades, although the majority of us may have becomerecently aware thanks to movies like The Matrix. Nevertheless, hacking culture has been outthere, and has been constantly influencing our society and the way we view the world. Fromanime to computer knowledge, hacker culture has, steadily, made its way to our lives.</p>


<h3>What Is Hacker Culture?</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Hacker culture is composed by all those experiences and human manifestations that are relatedto the exploit of hardware and software. Right now there are three kinds of hackers. The firstand most known kind of hacker is the black hat hacker, or the individual who uses hisknowledge for obtaining a personal benefit. Usually, it means stealing information that can besold in the black market.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The most daring black hat hackers are able to crack bank accounts, leaving no trace behind.Fortunately, bank security and worldwide cooperation has been able to place some restrictionsand control over these individuals.On the other side of the balance is the white hack hacker, a computer security expert whoworks with organizations and helps them with their computer network security problems.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Finally, there are the grey hat hackers. This kind of hackers is composed by people who walkthe thin line between white hat hackers and black hat hackers. Usually, their tendency will beinfluenced by their need of money or their lust for recognition among the hacker community.</p>




<h2>Which Are The Origins Of Hacker Culture?</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

It could be said that hackers have existed since immemorial times. Although the Merriam-Webster dictionary portrays a hacker as a computer expert, in reality, a hacker is any personwho looks for weaknesses in the system and tries to exploit them in their own benefit.

 

Under this definition, Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, was a hacker. Howso? He noticed that there were a series of weaknesses in the armies of ancient Greece. In orderto exploit them in his favor, he decided to implement a series of improvements to his ownarmy. As history has showed us, these improvements worked in his favor and in favor of hisfamous son.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The same could be said from Napoleon, who noticed that mobility and artillery could be used insuch a way that no army in Europe would be able to withstand him. Unfortunately for him, heforgot to consider that logistics were an important thing to consider when he mobilizedhundreds of thousands of men into the Russian Empire.</p>





<h2>Know where you belong in the Hacker Culture</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



However, it wasn't until the advent of the industrial revolution, and the appearance of thephone network, that the first hackers of the modern era appeared. In those days, the operatorsof this network were men. Unfortunately,many of them had a knack and a desire to exploit this system in their own benefit. Due to thisfact, all men operators were fired and new, women operators were contracted (a practice thatcontinued for many decades).</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The next revolution in hacker culture came with the appearance of the first computers in theuniversities around the country. Groups of students at the MIT were paid for developing theoperating software of the giant computer mainframes. In order to make their work easier,these young men created hacks, or shortcuts, to determined sensitive areas of their programming.</p>



<h3>Are There Any Subcultures?</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



In computer hacker culture there are two divisions. The first one is known as the Academichacker subculture, composed by the students, engineers and professionals who had the abilityto use the machines provided by universities. These people worked in computer science andhad the latest in technology. Many of them were able to use their knowledge and expertise inthe second division.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The other hacker subculture is the one which has its origins in hobbyists; people who builtcomputers in their garages (ala Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the founders of Apple) or werequite good with electronics (many of the were subscribed to specialized magazines). Thissubculture had its first golden age with the advent of personal computers and the firstcomputer games.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Thousands of people across America looked for ways to hack computer game passwords and copy-protection schemes (in those days there was no internet, so the computer game companies weren't ableto check online if your copy was an original). However, the true revolution came with the internet.</p>
 

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Now, hackers from around the world could hack, literally, millions of computers thanks to theweaknesses found at Microsoft Windows products and the lack of knowledge of computer users (only asmall percentage makes constant software upgrades, and has a firewall, an antivirus and a spyware installed).</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Finally, if you wish to learn hacking culture, or embrace it, start with some movies and literature! TheMatrix is an excellent place to begin, but there are also excellent science fiction and non-fiction booksthat can transport you to a world you never imagined. One of the most popular ones is Neuromancer,written by William Gibson.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


For many, hacking culture has become their way of life. Bored with the standardized lifestyle of thewestern civilization, hackers and it millions of new followers have created their own niche among ourtechnological society. Hacker culture, once considered part of the underground, is now part of us.</p>
