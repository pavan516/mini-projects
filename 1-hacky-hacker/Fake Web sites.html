Fake bank websites stealing account numbers and passwords have become
increasingly common with the growth of online financial transactions. Hence, when
using online banking, we should take precautions like using a secure encrypted
customer's certificate, surf the net following the correct procedure, etc.
First, the scammers create a similar website homepage; then they send out e-mails
with enticing messages to attract visitors. </p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



They may also use fake links to link internet
surfers to their website. Next, the fake website tricks the visitors into entering their
personal information, credit card information or online banking account number and
passwords. After obtaining a user's information, the scammers can use the information
to drain the bank accounts, shop online or create fake credit cards and other similar
crimes.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Usually, there will be a quick search option on these fake websites, luring users to
enter their account number and password. When a user enters their account number
and password, the website will respond with a message stating that the server is under
maintenance. Hence, we must observe the following when using online banking:
Observe the correct procedure for entering a banking website. Do not use links
resulting from searches or links on other websites.

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Online banking certifications are currently the most effective security safeguard
measure.
Do not easily trust e-mails, phone calls, and short messages, etc. that asks for your
account number and passwords.

Phishers often impost a well-known enterprise while sending their e-mails by
changing the sender's e-mail address to that of the well known enterprise, in order to
gain people's trust. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



The 'From' column of an e-mail is set by the mail software and can
be easily changed by the web administrator. Then, the Phisher creates a fake
information input website, and send out e-mails containing a link to this fake website
to lure e-mail recipients into visiting his fake website. Most Phishers create imitations
of well known enterprises websites to lure users into using their fake websites. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Even
so, a user can easily notice that the URL of the website they're entering has no relation
to the intended enterprise. Hence, Phishers may use different methods to impersonate
enterprises and other people. A commonly used method is hiding the URL. This can
easily be done with the help of JavaScript. Another way is to exploit the loopholes in
an internet browser, for instance, displaying a fake URL in the browser's address bar.
The security loophole causing the address bar of a browser to display a fake URL is a
commonly used trick and has often been used in the past. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



For example, an e-mail in
HTML format may hold the URL of a website of a well-known enterprise, but in
reality, the link connects to a fake website. The key to successfully use a URL similar
to that of the intended website is to trick the visual senses. For example, the sender's
address could be disguised as that of Nikkei BP, and the link set to
http://www.nikeibp.co.jp/which has one k less than the correct URL which is
http://www.nikkeibp.co.jp/. The two URLs look very similar, and the difference
barely noticeable. Hence people are easily tricked into clicking the link. Besides the
above, there are many more scams that exploit the trickery of visual senses.
Therefore, you should not easily trust the given sender's name and a website's
appearance. Never click on unfamiliar and suspicious URLs on a webpage. Also,
never enter personal information into a website without careful scrutiny.</p>





<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Internet Explorer 7 and Fire-fox 2 both have sophisticated filters that can detect most
fake websites.
Here are some other clues that might give away a fake:</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

• Look for evidence of a real-world presence: an address, a phone number, an
email contact. If in doubt, send an email, make a phone call or write a letter to
establish whether they really exist.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">

• The website's address is different from what you are used to, perhaps there are
extra characters or words in it or it uses a completely different name or no name
at all, just numbers.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">


• Right-clicking on a hyperlink and selecting "Properties" should reveal a link's
true destination - beware if this is different from what is displayed in the email.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">


• Even though you are asked to enter private information there is NO padlock in
the browser window or 'https://' at the beginning of the web address to signify
that it is using a secure link and that the site is what it says it is.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

• A request for personal information such as user name, password or other
security details IN FULL, when you are normally only asked for SOME of
Types of Hacking Attack and their Counter Measure 49
them.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">



• Although rare, it is possible for your computer to be corrupted by viruses in such
a way that you can type a legitimate website address into your browser and still
end up at a fake site. This problem is known as 'pharming'. Check the address in
your browser's address bar after you arrive at a website to make sure it matches
the address you typed. Subtle changes ('eebay' instead of 'ebay' for example)
may indicate that your computer is a victim of a pharming attack.</p>




<h2>Pharming</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Similar in nature to phishing, Pharming (pronounced farming) is a Hacker's attack
aiming to redirect a website's traffic to another, bogus website. Pharming can be
conducted either by changing the hosts file on a victim's computer or by exploitation
of a vulnerability in DNS server software. DNS servers are computers responsible for
resolving Internet names into their real addresses - they are the "signposts" of the
Internet.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

 Compromised DNS servers are sometimes referred to as "poisoned". The
term pharming is a word play on farming and phishing. The term phishing refers to
social engineering attacks to obtain access credentials such as user names and
passwords. In recent years pharming has been used to steal identity information.
Pharming has become of major concern to businesses hosting ecommerce and online
banking websites.
