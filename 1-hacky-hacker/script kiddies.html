A wannabe hacker is a script kiddie. These people don't have strong knowledge of hacking, instead they use readymade tools (by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These types of hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming.</p>





<h2>What is a Script Kiddie?</h2>

Script kiddie is commonly heard when talking about hacker culture. Other terms that are used interchangeably with script kiddie are the following: skiddie, skid, script kitty, script bunny, and script-running juvenile (SRJ). This is a, rather, offensive term utilized in order to name the individuals who make use of programs and scripts that are created by other experts in instigating an assault against various networks and computer systems.</p>




<h2>Cracker of Security Systems</h2>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Script kiddie was originally coined by the more refined crackers of the security system of machines. The name was invented for the purpose of labeling the individuals who are still in the process of learning. The script kiddies are considered to be at the same level with the treacherous exploiters of the holes in the security of the Internet.</p>

More than usual, script kiddies utilize the programs or scripts on hand as well as the distinguished techniques for the purpose of finding and abusing the vulnerabilities of a machine. These immature individuals do not realize and consider that using these pre-made scripts also has equivalent probable damaging results.</p>

Underdeveloped People are

Those who are known to be experts in hacking spew words of disapproval when regarding the said script kiddies. They believe that these entities do not provide anything that can contribute to the progress of the art of hacking. In addition, the hackers think that these underdeveloped people only make situations worst by infuriating the authority. The resentment of the security authorities does not only affect the script kiddies but also the whole hacker community.</p>

Hackers are very much particular with the things that they do. When they execute an attack, they make it to a point that no traces of the illegal access will be left. Script kiddies are the complete opposites of these highly-knowledgeable hackers.</p>

Script kiddies usually seek for the quantity rather than the quality of the attacks that they initiate. They believe that they can get the spotlight towards themselves by showing the world that they have generated large number of assaults. But then, the media depicts these individuals as teenagers who are too bored and are in need of just a little attention from their friends.</p>

In programming and hacking culture, a script kiddie or skiddie[1] (also known as skid and RTM|Modding(mean a BLENDER),[2] the term script kitty[3] is not valid in this context) is an unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites. </p>

It is generally assumed that script kiddies are juveniles who lack the ability to write sophisticated programs or exploits on their own and that their objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in computer-enthusiast communities.[4] However, the term does not relate to the actual age of the participant. The term is generally considered to be pejorative.</p>
