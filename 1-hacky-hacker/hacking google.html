Basically, it's the ability to use Google for finding hidden bits of data or information that thehacker can use for his advantage. Or in other words, hacking Google search appliance. How so?Let's say that you are a black hacker (someone who uses his hacking abilities for selfishpurposes) and want to access the email account of a chosen victim.

How can the hacker learn it?</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">

Besides asking the pet's name to his victim (which is very suspicious), it's probable that that bitof information is lost somewhere in the internet. Maybe the owner went into a forum regardingpet insurance and left inside the name of his dog. These are the kind of things that Googlepermits to find.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
