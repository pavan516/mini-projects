<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



A hacker is a person who finds enjoyment in increasing the capacity of any device. When thepersonal computers appeared, hackers turned their attention to them and a new undergroundwas created.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Among the public opinion the media is widelyresponsible for reporting crackers as hackers. Their lack of knowledge on means adopted byhackers and crackers has brought a bad name to hackers as well.Nowadays three type of hackers can be found: white, grey and black. White hackers are thosewho use their knowledge for selling their services to clients who want to protect theirnetworks.</p>



<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


 Black hackers (also known as crackers) are the ones who attack those networks andtry to make some money out of it.Grey hackers are more ambiguous. They don't do it for the money; they do it for the rush. Theywant to show the world and their hacker friends how good they are.

 
 
So, were does ethical hackers fall? Well, they are inside the white hackers group. But being awhite hacker doesn't transform you into an ethical hacker. There are some things that you needto do first.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The first requirement is to be trustworthy. And for that, you will need to make a name. How?You need to start from the beginning: down. The first step is academic.

This is anexcellent method to show the world how preoccupied you are for computer security and thatyou have a desire to protect people from the dangers of the internet.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



The main advantage for a cracker that wants to turn to the light side is that he has hugeamounts of knowledge of how the dark side works. What a better way to combat the enemy if you have been among it's ranks? Although many employers look for this kind of ex-crackersturned to ethical hackers, most of the corporations of the information technology (IT) industrydon't want to have anything to do with them because businesses are based on a relation of trust with their clients. </p>

And many of them want a full profile on the people who are going towork very close to their systems and the information stored inside.Would you open your doors to someone who has been known in the past as a criminal? Not
 
 
likely, since you don't want to compromise your organization. How do you really know that theex-cracker has left behind his old practices?For that reason, the IT companies that offer services for network protection or computersecurity prefer to contract people with a clean record, why the media prefer to contractfreelancers who have turned to the light side. Why? It gives them an additional edge to theirnews. After all, they "live of the rating". What a better thing than a declaration by someonewho was a cracker?</p>

He needs to be able toget inside the systems of its client and detect any possible holes that could be exploited by acracker.And the offered pay? At first, the average is US$40, 000 per year. But as you gain experienceand reputation inside the community, your income will increase as well as your number of clients. </p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
