Within the past couple of years there has been an increasingly evident trend of political and environmental activists turning to the Internet as a platform for making protests. These people, who for ideological reasons deliberately interfere with online data and services, have been dubbed hacktivists.</p>

The hacktivist uses the same digital tools as the hacker, but does so in order to bring attention to a political or ideological cause
Unlike the work of the hacker, who is usually associated with criminal activity, especially the illicit transfer of money or sensitive information, hacktivism operates just within the boundaries of legality, exploiting the concept of freedom of speech. The hacktivist uses the same digital tools as the hacker, but does so in order to bring attention to a political or ideological cause.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


 One such example from the recent past was the disruption of the websites of a large number of perfume companies, who were targeted by green hacktivists because they disagreed with the way these firms made and tested their products. In early 2010, political hacktivists blocked access to a number of Australian government websites in protest at plans to filter content.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Among the techniques used by hacktivists are the unsolicited modification of a website's home page to display a highly visible message, or the launch of what is called a denial of service attack. Often called a DoS for short, a denial of service attack is the temporary loss of network connectivity and services such as e-mail, which in some cases can cause a website accessed by millions to temporarily shut down.</p>


<h2>Background – hacktivist and hacktivism</h2>



<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Incidents of hacktivism stretch back over the last 15 years or more, but in the last couple of years have become more frequent and had increasingly damaging effects.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The terms hacktivist and hacktivism date back to the mid-1990s, though one of the earliest recorded incidents of the concept in action occurred some years earlier. In October 1989, anti-nuclear protestors wanting to stop a radioactive-fuelled space probe, launched WANK (Worms Against Nuclear Killers), a program that sabotaged the login screens of NASA computer networks and reportedly cost NASA nearly half a million dollars in wasted time and resources.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The word hacktivist is a blend of hack and activist. The verb hack has its origins in the old English haccian, meaning 'cut into pieces'. The sense relating to gaining unauthorised access to computer data is comparatively recent, dating back to 1983.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Hacktivists are sometimes alternatively referred to as cyber-activists. Another recent neologism on the same theme is slacktivist, which describes a political activist who may have been active in the past, but now does very little to support a cause, or only does things that require minimal effort.</p>




<h2>Definition - What does Hacktivism mean?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Hacktivism is the act of hacking a website or computer network in an effort to convey a social or political message. The person who carries out the act of hacktivism is known as a hacktivist.

In contrast to a malicious hacker who hacks a computer with the intent to steal private information or cause other harm, hacktivists engage in similar forms of disruptive activities to highlight political or social causes. For the hacktivist, hacktivism is an Internet-enabled strategy to exercise civil disobedience. Acts of hacktivism may include website defacement, denial-of-service attacks (DoS), redirects, website parodies, information theft, virtual sabotage and virtual sit-ins.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Hacktivism and hacktivists are motivated by an active desire to cripple government control and censorship of electronic and Web technologies and content. As such, hacktivism may be employed by those opposing rigorous copyright regulations or fervently interested in circumventing restricted electronic data.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


A key hacktivism tool fueled by the Internet is techno-politics, where hacktivists voice public opinions and stances regarding repressive legislation hindering open access to computer software and websites. Hacktivists educate the public on perceived regulatory injustices and encourage response. Hacktivists continuously initiate and engage in court battles challenging freedom of Internet speech and other digital media restrictions. </p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Hacktivism addresses a variety of acts that are active and passive - as well as violent and non-violent - and may be falsely interpreted as cyberterrorism. Hacktivism was originally coined to explain how electronic direct action elicits social change through blended programming expertise and critical thinking. Despite this, many perceive hacktivism as an attempt to fulfill undesirable political motives.</p>
