&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Yes. As a matter of fact, almost anything can be hacked in the Internet. The problem is that emailaccounts are the repositories were people store their private information or even their business data. Itis a quite serious condition and most of the mail providers have taken some measures for stopping it.Unfortunately, users don't take them seriously and they don't follow the precautions.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


There are several methods for hacking yahoo, msn or AOL email accounts. One of these methods issocial engineering. Considered a revolutionary art among the hacker community, it has proven to be aninteresting tool that can be exploited by anyone.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Social engineering consists in the ability to trick someone in believing that he is giving information tosomeone who has the authority to ask for it. The most common way to do it is through the telephone orvia the internet. Let's say that a user receives a call from someone who identifies himself as a system administrator of his company and that he requires some information that could be considered harmless.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

It's quite probable that that bit of information is the final piece that the hacker required for finishing hiswork. Something as innocent as when was the last time that the system asked the user to change hispassword could be used by him in his advantage.A quite ingenious method within social engineering was a webpage were users required to enter theirmail and password for finding if someone had deleted or blocked them from their Instant Messenger

 
 34(IM). Unfortunately, many fell under this scheme. Hacking yahoo messenger or any other messenger isquite easy if you find how to exploit the user's needs.</p>


<h2>Yahoo Password Hacking with Keyloggers</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Besides social engineering, hackers can obtain your password through other means, like worms,viruses or Trojans. Once a hacker is inside your computer, he will look for those files were yourlogin names and passwords are stored.That's they reason why it isn't considered safe to store them inside your computer. Even whenthe provider tells you that it is safe. Remember than there isn't a more secure place for keepingyour password than your mind.</p>


<h3>What Methods Were Used In The Past?</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

In the past, one of the common practices used by hacker was using programs that trieddifferent password combinations until it found the correct one. This method was contra restedby email providers by giving a limited number of options or by placing some security measuresinside their webpage.Other method was placing false web pages instead of the original ones. A hacker could make auser think that he is accessing his email at the webpage of his email provider. In reality, he wasentering all his information to a webpage created by the hacker. This scheme isn't used anymore since users have become a bit more careful and have acquired some concepts on internetsecurity. They have started using secure pages for login which starts with "https:\\....." in theaddress bar.</p>


<h3>What Are Keyloggers?</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Keyloggers are specially devised programs that are installed inside a computer via a Trojan, avirus or a worm. Once inside, the keylogger will auto execute and start recording all the keystrokes made by the computer user. Once a determined period of time has gone by, thekeylogger will send the keystroke information to the hacker who sent this infectious software.Then the hacker will start searching key combinations that can lead him to determine thepassword for determined web pages. This simple and effective method is a favorite amonghackers since it can provide them with lots of private information from their victims.

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Many computer users have more than one email account, especially if they use the messengerservices from multiple providers, like Microsoft's Hotmail, Yahoo's Email or AOL email. Itdoesn't matter if you have one or many email accounts, every one of them may be a victim of a
 

hacker. Even with the security measures imposed by the companies, Yahoo password hackingor hotmail hacking still exist. And it's very improbable that will disappear.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


So, if you want to protect yourself from people who are hacking yahoo accounts or whosewhole purpose in life is to do some MSN hacking, then increase the number of specialcharacters in your password and try not to access your email account from a computer that isnot yours. And that goes to IM's too. The ability for hacking yahoo messenger or any other IMprovider it's a latent danger for all of us.</p>
