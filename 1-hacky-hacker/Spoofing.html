A technique used to gain unauthorized access to computers, whereby the intruder
sends messages to a computer with an IP address indicating that the message is
coming from a trusted host. </p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


To engage in IP spoofing, a hacker must first use a variety
of techniques to find an IP address of a trusted host and then modify the packet
headers so that it appears that the packets are coming from that host.</p>

A closely interconnected and often confused term with phishing and pharming is
spoofing. A "spoofer", in Internet terms, is defined generally as the "cracker" who
alters, or "forges", an e-mail address, pretending to originate a message from a
different source address than that which he or she truly has.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



 There are many ways an
attacker may do this, and there are many types of attacks. The attacker may do this to
gain access to a secured site that would accept the "hijacked" address as one of few
permissible addresses, or more maliciously, the reason may be to hide the source of
any type of attack.</p>

 Email spoofing is often an attempt to trick the user into making a
damaging statement or releasing sensitive information (such as passwords).</p>




<h2>Spoofing Attacks Techniques</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Spoofing attacks can be divided into different categories, some of which are
elaborated below:



<h2>Man-in-the-middle attack and internet protocol spoofing</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


An example from cryptography is the man-in-the-middle attack, in which an attacker
spoofs Alice into believing they're Bob, and spoofs Bob into believing they're Alice,
thus gaining access to all messages in both directions without the trouble of any.</p>
