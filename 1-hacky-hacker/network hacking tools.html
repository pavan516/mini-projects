<h2>Hacking Servers: Organized Crime</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

 
In the old days, twenty years ago, hackers didn't have the same variety of tools for networkhacking. With the appearance of the Internet, network hacking tools are now widespreadphenomena.And anyone who wishes to become a hacker, he/she may do so. They only need a computer, aninternet account, some knowledge on using search engines and they can start to hack;password windows, for example, will become an easy exercise for him.</p>


<h2>What Are The Different Types Of Servers That Hackers Prefer?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

The most preferred kind of server is those related to government agencies and big companies.Have you ever wondered how many attacks does a company like Microsoft receive each day?Although there are millions of computer users around the world who don't maintain adequatesecurity of their computers, most hackers ignore them because they are too easy to access. If they want to increase their reputation and their skills, they know that the bigger fish offer abigger challenge.</p>


<h2>How Does The Hacker Gain Entry To The Server?</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       


It doesn't matter if it is computer security or the security of a building. If someone wants totrespass it, he will look for the weakest points in the system. If you want to penetrate abuilding, you need to make some surveillance first. Learn the movements of the guards, findout what kind of equipment are they using and maybe make some small test to check howgood the security is.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

The same thing happens with a hacker that wants to get into a determined network. He willneed to make some surveillance first, looking for the weak spots. For doing this, there are aseries of tools that a hacker can use, like network password hacking programs that have beendeveloped by password hackers. But the most common tool is the port scanner.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

Imagine your network as a bus terminal, where you have buses that come and go in determinedperiods of time. The same thing passes inside a network, where information comes and goesdepending on the requirements of the users. With a port scanner, a hacker can look for those

 
entrances in the terminal that don't have adequate security. Once he has assured that it isvulnerable enough, he will use it for getting inside. This is also known as remote hacking.</p>




<h2>Hack Servers Easily: Network Hacking Tools</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

Another way that hackers use to get inside networks, like hacking teamspeak servers or hackingwindows terminal services, is thanks to the unknown help of the network users. How? Simple,they send emails with attachments that will execute a worm, virus or Trojan that will spreadinto the network.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       


If it is a Trojan horse, this little program will convert the computer into a zombie, under thecontrol of its creator. Thanks to it, the hacker will gain a way to enter the network withoutbeing detected.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

A virus used for network hacking is a bit different. Although it spreads in similar ways to Trojanhorses (through email attachments or downloaded files from peer to peer networks), theycause havoc and destruction inside the network. A hacker will make use of this panic situationand try to enter the system while its defenses are down. It may be considered a parallel to thesiege strategies of ancient history, when cities were intentionally infected with diseases by their enemies.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       


Worms are similar to viruses, but have a slight difference. They are self contained and do notrequire of other file, as a virus does, to infect a computer. Their main application for networkhackers are installing backdoors inside computers. Once the new "door" is secure, the hackerwill use that entrance to establish a position inside the network.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       


Hackers can even install a key logger for remote password hacking and the user will never knowhow they did it! Of course, someone could think that all of the fault is with the operatingsystem Windows, but in reality, the amount of people who are hacking Windows XP is notbecause the program is bad. It is because most of the planet uses it as it's operating system.</p>




<h2>What Tools Does He Use?</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

If you are a hacker who just began his activities, it's most probable that you will download oneof the dozens of free tools that are available in the internet. These programs have beenpreviously made and tested by more experienced hackers. When you trespass the barrier of experience and become a seasoned hacker, then you may start making improvements overthese old programs. Or even you may start creating your own network hacking software.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

Since internet is always evolving (getting bigger and implementing new tools and software) it isan almost infinite source of fun for a hacker who wants to test his skills.</p>



<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       
 
 
If you want to make scan the ports of a network, there are several freewares available. Themost common ones are Portscan 2000, Scanmetender Standard, Angry IP Scanner, Netmon ,Fast TCP Port Scanner, nmap and Unicorn scan.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

In the case of worms, viruses and Trojan horses, the list is almost infinite. And with each monththat passes, hackers improve or make slight modifications to these programs so they are notdetected by the security systems.And, if you are using a wireless network, do not think that you are more secure than atraditional network. As a matter of fact, hacking wireless networks is easier for a hacker sincemany users don't know how to configure it.</p>




<h2>What Is The Damage When Automated Tools Are Used?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       


It doesn't matter if you are a network hacker who is trying a windows 2000 password hack or asystem administrator that wants to defend from a password hacker. In either case, you need tolearn the tricks of this job and maintain yourself updated on the latest trends and networkhacking tools. </p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       

Consider how the world was fifteen years ago, with virtually no Internet and withmost computers using DOS (the precursor to Windows). Although those good old days aregone, network hacking hasn't, and will never disappear.</p>
