&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 


 MMORPG stands for Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. There are many of these gamesnow available, thanks to the appearance of the internet. Basically, it is a virtual world in which you canplay a determined character and interact with other people located in different parts of the planet.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


The intention of the MMORPG is to acquire experience, or skills, in order to advance in the game. Thatway, your character acquires more knowledge and power, which can be used for acquiring better itemsand for fighting more difficult adversaries. In most of the cases, you need to pay a monthly fee forplaying the game.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

The revenue of this industry is, approximately, of US$1.3 billion, and it is expected to triplicate by theyear 2009. Most of the gamers come from the United States, South Korea and China. AlthoughMMORPG may be considered something new, they are quite old (in computer terms), since they go backto the mid 1990's.</p>


<h2>Why Do Hackers Target Runescape Accounts?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Now that we understand more about the popularity of Massive Multiplayer Online Role-PlayingGames, and especially the popularity of Runescape, it is obvious why so many people areinterested in hacking Runescape accounts. However, what is the final intention of creatinghacking programs for Runescape?</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Hackers are strange persons. Their motives can be varied, depending on their alignment. Thereare white hackers (people who hack computers for ethical reasons, e.g. help corporations withtheir security systems), black hackers (individuals who hack computers in order to obtain abenefit for themselves), and grey hackers (persons who walk a mid-line between white andblack hackers, depending on their mood, or their need for money).</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

So, they can do it for obtaining a personal benefit. For example, they may detect a Runescapecharacter that has a high level and a lot of valuable items. They may hack it in order to stealthem their belongings and use them for their own character. Of course, there is no court toappeal to. There isn't a legal frame that protects people from these kinds of acts. Yet.</p>


<h2>How Are Runescape Accounts Hacked?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Hacking on Runescape can come from different sources. One of them is by the use of determined programs, for example, a Runescape file that has been tampered and hanged up ina download site. All the victims who download it can be the subjects of intrusion by a hacker.</p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Spyware is another mean to hack your Runescape account. A specially designed program couldbe installed, without your knowledge, in your computer. This program will store in a file all thekeys that you digit while using your PC. After determined amount of data has been collected,the program will send the info back to its creator. Simple but devious.</p>


<h2>How Can I Prevent Runescape Hacking?</h2>
 
 
<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

Another step that you need to take is to assure yourself that you have installed a firewall, ananti-spyware program and an antivirus, running in real time. The lack of any of these three canbe an open invitation for any hacker who wants to steal your character's equipment andtreasure.Another important measure is to be careful from where do you download the game. Use onlyofficial sites. Avoid strange mirror sites or downloads from peer-to-peer file sharing programslike Kazaa, EMule or even BitTorrent. You may not know if the program was tampered or not.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp


Unfortunately, hacking Runescape accounts isn't very difficult. All you need is some computerskills and a web browser in order to find the instructions for doing so. Or you can use one of themany hacking programs for Runescape that are available for free. So, be alert and beware of the numerous hackers that are lurking the web.</p>
