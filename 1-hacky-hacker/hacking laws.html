<h2>Computer Hacking Laws: Are These Laws Really Effective?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



The news said that another person had their identity stolen. It happened again. You might evenknow of someone that had it happen to them. We often hear of percentages - and they aresurprisingly high.Enforcement is taking place, but we have to wonder if computer hacking laws are really havingany effect against cyber hacking. This article will show what is being done against cyber crime.</p>


<h3>Defining Cyber Crime</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Hacking has a rather simple definition to it. Basically it is defined as the unauthorized use of acomputer - especially when it involves attempting to circumvent the security measures of thatcomputer, or of a network.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Hacking is not difficult to learn. Unfortunately, it may be too easy for someone that has a littletime on his hands. This becomes especially obvious when it is found that a number of thehackers, at least those that are caught, are often only in their teens.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Beyond this, there are two basic types of hacking. Some only hack because they want to see if they can do it - it is a challenge to them. For others, however, it becomes an attack, and theyuse their unauthorized access for destructive purposes. Hacking occurs at all levels and at alltimes - by someone, for some reason. It may be a teen doing it to gain peer recognition, or, athief, a corporate spy, or one nation against another.</p>




<h2>Effectiveness of Computer Hacking Laws</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Like any other law, the effectiveness must be determined by its deterrence. While there willalways be those that want to see if they can do it, and get away with it (any crime), there arealways the many more who may not do something if they are aware of its unlawfulness - andpossible imprisonment.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



In the early 1990's, when hacker efforts stopped AT&T communications altogether, the U.S.Government launched its program to go after the hackers. This was further stepped up when

 
 
government reports (by the GAO) indicate that there have been more than 250,000 attempts tohack into the Defense Department computers. First there were the laws - now came the bitebehind it. One of the effects of computer hacking brought about focused efforts to catch themand punish them by law.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp




Then, more recently, the U.S. Justice Department reveals that the National InfrastructureProtection Center has been created in order to protect our major communications,transportation and technology from the attack of hackers. Controlling teens and hackers hasbecome the focus of many governmental groups to stop this maliciousness against individuals,organizations, and nations.</p>





<h2>Computer Crimes: Hacking Never Pays</h2>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp




One of the most famous for his computer crimes hacking was Kevin Mitnick, who was trackedby computer, and caught in 1995. He served a prison sentence of about five years. Others havelikewise been caught. Another case is that of Vasily Gorshkov from Russia, who was 26 years oldwhen convicted in 2001.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp




He was found guilty of conspiracy and computer crime. Other individuals have also been foundguilty and sentenced -and many others remain on trial. If you are one who pays much attentionto the news, then you know that every now and then, you will hear of another hacker that hasbeen caught, or a group of hackers that have been arrested because of their criminal activities.The interesting thing is that it is often others who had learned hacking techniques, and are nowusing them to catch other criminal hackers.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Another criminal hacker, who called himself Tasmania, made big news when he fled Spain onvarious charges of stealing into bank accounts online, and banks, and went to Argentina. Therehe went into operation again. He was quickly tracked to Argentina, and the governments of Spain and Argentina went after him with surveillance, first. Before long, he was arrested, alongwith 15 other men, and was then extradited back to Spain (in 2006) where he could face up to40 years in prison.</p>




<h2>Detecting Hackers</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp




Most of the time, a hacker can enter your computer, look around and you will never know it.Neither Windows, nor most other general programs can detect hackers - until they startmessing around with your files. Windows, however, has now provided a number of updates forcomputer users, and it would be prudent to get them all downloaded and installed on yourcomputer as quickly as possible.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Another thing that will give you hacker protection is to make sure that you have an up to dateantivirus and anti-spyware program, along with a good firewall in place. Make sure that it is
 

capable of stopping general hacker attacks. Most likely there will be many daily attempts byhacker programs (running on automatic) to access your computer, but remember that it alsobecomes necessary to have an actual IP address of the attempted hack before you can actuallybe reporting hackers. Knowing how to catch a hacker with the right software is also available onthe Internet (much of it is free), and it will allow you to track and get the necessary information.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



While the tools and programs that hackers use to get access to your computer and yourinformation constantly get better, you need to know also that so is the software and protectionthat has recently become available to protect you from them. Remember that no program isfoolproof, and that you will need to be continually getting some of the newest and latestprotection, as well as keeping up with hacking protection news.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp



Cyber hacking will continue as long as there are computers and money to be gained from them.New computer hacking laws are also continually being added to the books, along with theagencies needed to enforce those laws. But, it is your own diligence in keeping your computerprotected that will help you most from becoming a victim of those cyber crimes.</p>
