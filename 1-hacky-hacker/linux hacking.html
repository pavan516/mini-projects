<h2>Hacking Linux : Programmers test themselves</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         

Since Microsoft has a huge chunk of the operating system's market in the world, it is the firstvictim of hackers. But that doesn't mean that Linux hacking doesn't exist. Although is lesscommon than it's close sourced companion, there are several reasons why hackers try to hackmachines with Linux.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


Many corporations use Linux as their serveron the web as it is cheaper and easier to deploy. Itssecurity is also better when compared to Microsoft operating systems. No wonder that networkhacking tools for this open source operating system have proliferated in the last years.</p>



<h2>What Are The Issues With Open Source Linux?</h2>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         



The main difference between Linux and Windows is that Linux is open source and windows areclosed source. So? Well, that means that only Microsoft is authorized to change any part of thecode of the Windows operating system. While in Linux, anyone can change it.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


The other problem is that the Linux Operating System doesn't receive the same level of supportas Windows does. That means that updates and security packages are released with each newversion of the Operating System (OS), but not as periodic updates as in the case of WindowsXP's Windows Update.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


That means that the user will have to be the one responsible for checking for the updatesinstead of trusting this matter to an organization. So, a user could pass long periods of timewithout knowing that his OS has an important security failure that could compromise his workor even the security of his network.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         



The only way to contra rest this inconvenient, is buying support from a determined Linux OSprovider, like Red Hat. For an annual fee, they will provide you with important information onthe different bugs that have been found in the OS and that need to be fixed.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


If you choose otherwise, you will spend a long time inside forums talking to Linux expertsaround the world. If that isn't the core competence of your business, why should you spendthat time doing it? That's one of the main arguments that Microsoft uses when comparing it'sOS with open source OS's.</p>

 
 
<h2>Vulnerabilities of the Linux Operating System</h2>
<h3>What Are The Vulnerabilities?</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


The main vulnerability of Linux OS is that anyone can access the code of the operating system.And, if you are not savvy enough with the programming code like hackers are. You only need tosearch for the correct free Linux hacking tool and you will be able to get inside in no time.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


The other problem is that many of the drivers made for determined hardware. Let's say, aprinter is not created by people who have security in mind. This is specially important for acompany who do not wish to find it's intellectual property is stolen each time they sendsomething to the printing room.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


So, after all of these possible loopholes inside Linux OS, you should consider using a versionthat has been designed with security in mind. Check www.engardelinux.com and find moreabout this variation of Linux OS.</p>



<h3>What Is Kernel Hacking?</h3>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         



The kernel is the software inside a computer that is in charge of maintaining an adequatecommunication between the hardware and the rest of the software. One of the strong pointsamong the Linux community is that the kernel of a Linux OS can be altered. And for whatreason? The two main motives are fixing any problem that may arise and increase the efficiencyof a driver responsible for managing a determined piece of hardware.</p>



<h3>Hacking Runescape</h3>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


Runescape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game that was launched in 2001 byJagex Limited. The marvelous thing about this online game is that it is independent of theoperating system that you are using since it works over the web using JAVA (JAVA is a platformthat can work in any kind of computer since it creates a virtual machine for its own use).</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         




But as in any online game, you will find people who are hacking Runescape. Although it is freeto use and only requires some basic information for it's subscription, some hackers are willingto spend their time trying to find a backdoor or any other scheme that will permit them obtainan advantage over other players. One could say that it is inevitable due to the competitivenature of our species.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         




So, Runescape hacking, hacking programs for Runescape, free password hacking programs for
 
 
Runescape, files for hacking Runescape and hacking Runescape accounts has become quitecommon among players. Although some could say that there is no grace in doing this since it isbasically cheating, hackers don't think the same. For them, using any method for being the bestin the game isn't only good; it's what is expected from any human being.</p>


<p style="font-size:140%;">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         


Thanks to free network hacking tools, hackers from around the world with a basic knowledge of English and some practice with computers, can start lurking networks everywhere, waiting fortheir chance to success and increase their reputation inside the hacking community. Althoughright now Windows is the preferred platform, Linux hacking will become a favorite among sthackers</p>
