		<h3>STARTUP BloodCenter- Platform For Users To Contact The Donors Directly At No Cost -THE PORTAL BLOODCENTER IS IN A QUEST TO PROVIDE
		THE PATIENTS BLOOD AT THE REQUIRED TIME AND AT FREE OF COST </h3>	<br> 
			 
		
       
		  
		
		<p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

		     Well, there are a lot of people who are in need of something at each and every instance of their lives. But health is something all a person 
			 cares when he is not well. There are a lot a cases where many people breathe their last due to unavailability of donors. Here the blood center 
			 is striving to solve people’s great need.
        </p>
		
		
		<p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

		    Blood center is a social service platform where the victims can avail the desired blood group at almost free of cost.
             It directly provides interface to the victim and the donor itself unlike the usual blood bank where they collect and store it.

        </p>
		
		<center><h2>THE EUREKA MOMENT FOR BLOODCENTER</center></h2>
		
		
		<p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

		    Pavan Kumar is the founder and CEO of BloodCenter and has been exceptional in providing blood to the victims ever since its exception.
           He says that when he met with a disaster and was in need of blood very badly he faced a lot of difficulties in getting the blood and
               one doesn’t know the candidness of the blood they are offering.</p>
			   
		<p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
	   
      Finally a donor stepped forward to donate him blood thus saving him 
      from this and this led him to have the thought that he would never make any one suffer because of what he has suffered and this was 
      how BloodCenter was born. BloodCenter is tied up with a lot of hospitals in and around Hyderabad and is serving people at its best.
        </p>
		
		<center><h2>FUTURE PLANS</center></h2>
		
		<p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

		    Pavan is of the opinion that as his startup is a social platform providing services to victims all around the city it 
        is going to grow leaps and bounds in a few years as there is awareness among people that donating blood is good for health 
        and it produces fresh blood after you donate. They are planning to extend it to different cities in the coming years.
       It is totally bootstrapped and is looking for funds to extend their services.
        </p>
	 
	 <center><h2>INFORMATION</center></h2>

        <p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

		    People Come in all different shapes,sizes and with different blood types. However, for a small percentage of the population, finding someone 
			else with the same blood type is difficult.
        </p>
 
         <p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

           So, we are trying to gather all blood donors, blood banks at one place in our Blood Center. It is the place where we can get any type of 
			blood group.It is the place where we contact the blood donors directly
        </p>
 
        <p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

 
 
         There are many poor people who cant buy blood , so it is the place where they can find free blood donors.it is the place where nearly 50 blood bank 
		 hospitals are collaborating.
          </p>

        <p style="font-size:140%;">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

        Everyone can donate blood , As it is good for health. Donating blood for every 3 months makes human being very healthy.According to doctor precription ,
        donating blood is gud , as it generates fresh blood in our body.
